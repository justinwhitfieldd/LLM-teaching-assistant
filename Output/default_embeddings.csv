tests pass. If the tests pass, the developer can be confident that the

once all tests pass.
3.   Refactor
 Refactor the code to improve non-functional code structure, style, and quality
 Confirm tests pass. If one or more tests fail, the refactor caused problems; 
edit until all tests pass. If the "
