"Chapter  4Boolean LogicBoolean Logic?
Write a program that will take (or accept) a value from the 
user and print the corresponding letter grade.  For 
instance, if the user enters 91, the program prints an A.  
But if the user enters 68, the program prints a D.
In order to solve this problem, we need to be able to 
compare values.  That’s the basis of Boolean Logic.b00l data type

>>> A = 3.14*r*r  
>>> print A

Notation is different.

>>> r = 10  
>>> A = 3.14*r**2  
>>> print A

>>> A = 3.14*r**2

r and A are variables . In algebra, we h"
"ave  
the notion of a variable too. But there are  
some big differences.  Variables  
A variable is a named memory location. Think of a 
variable as a box.  
It contains a value. Think of the value as the 
contents  of the box.

“ The value of  r is 10. The value of A is 314.0.”  The Assignment Statement

variable r and assigns to it the valu"

A variable can be used in an expression  like 
   3.14*r**2 . 
The expression is evaluated and then stored.

In Python,  
    t = t + 10  
 
means add 10 to the value of t and store  
the result in t.

>>> Area = 3.14*radius**2                   
 
radius ->  10  Area ->  314.0  
A good name for a variable  is short but suggestive of its role:   Circle_Area   Precedence  
Q.  In an arithmetic expression, what is  
 the order of evaluation?  
A.  Exponentiation & negation comes before 
 multiplication & division which in turn 
 come before additio"
"n & subtraction.  
It is a good habit to use parentheses if there is the slightest ambiguity.  This:                        Is the same as:  
  A + B*C         A + (B*C)  
  -A**2/4         -(A**2)/4  
  A*B/C*D        ((A*B)/C)*D  
 
 Revisit Circle Area  
It seems that Python evaluates (22/7) as 
3 instead of 3.142…  WHY?   
>>> r = 10  
>>> A = (22/7)*r**2  
>>> print A  
300.0                    
 
A different kind of arithmetic. We have a related experience here.  
11+3 = 2 in “clock arithmetic”  Integ"
"ers and Decimals  
In math we distinguish between integer 
numbers and decimal numbers.  
 
Integer Numbers:    
  100, 0, -89, 1234567  
 
Decimal Numbers:  
  -2.1, 100.01, 100.0, 12.345  
 
 Integers and Decimals  
 
There are different kinds of division.  
 
Integer Division:    
  30/8  is 3 with a remainder of 6  
 
Decimal Division:  
  30/8 is 3.75  
 
 int vs float 
In Python, a number has a type. 
 
The int type represents numbers as 
integers.  
 
The float  type represents numbers as 
decimals. "
" 
 
 
 Important to understand the differences and the interactions  int Arithmetic  
To get the remainder, use %. Python “knows” that the values stored in x and y have 
type int because there are no decimal points in those assignments.  >>> x = 30  
>>> y = 8  
>>> q = x/y  
>>> print q  
3 
>>> r = x%y 
>>> print r  
6                   
 float Arithmetic   
Python “knows” that the values stored in x and y have type float because there are 
decimal points in those assignments.  >>> x = 30.  
>>> y = 8.  
"
">>> q = x/y  
>>> print q  
3.75 
 Mixing float and int  
In Python if one operand has type float and the other has type int, then the type 
int value is converted to float and the evaluation proceeds.  >>> x = 30.  
>>> y = 8  
>>> q = x/y  
>>> print q  
3.75 
 Explicit Type Conversion   
     int( -expression - ) converts the value of the expression to  int value  >>> x = 30.0  
>>> y = 8.0  
>>> q = int(x)/int(y) 
>>> print q  
3 
 Explicit Type Conversion   
     float( -expression - ) converts the val"
"ue of the expression to a  float  >>> x = 30  
>>> y = 8  
>>> q = float(x)/float(y)  
>>> print q  
3.75 
 An Important Distinction   
>>> x = 1.0/3.0  
>>> print x  
.333333333333  
 Integer arithmetic is exact.  
Float arithmetic is (usually) not exact.  Strings  
So far we have discussed computation with  
numbers.  
 
Now we discuss computation with text.  
 
We use strings  to represent text.  
 
 You are a “string processor” when you realize  7/4 means July 4 and not 1.75!     Strings  
Strings are q"
"uoted characters. Here are three  
examples:   
>>> s1 = ‘ abc’ 
>>> s2 = ‘ABC’  
>>> s3 = ‘ A B C ‘  
 
 s1, s2, and s3 are variables with string value.  Strings  
Strings are quoted characters. Here are three  
examples:   
>>> s1 = ‘ abc’ 
>>> s2 = ‘ABC’  
>>> s3 = ‘ A B C ‘  
 
The values in s1,s2,and s3 are all different.  
Upper and lower case matters. Blanks matter  Strings  
Nothing special about letters…  
>>> Digits = ‘1234567890’  
>>> Punctuation = ‘!:;.?’  
>>> Special = @#$%^&*()_ -+=‘

exceptions and special rules. More later.  
 Here is one :  ‘Sophie”’”s  Choice’    i.e., Sophie’s Choice      Strings are Indexed  
 >>> s = ‘The Beatles’  
 
The characters in a string can be referenced  
through their indices.  Called “subscripting”.  
 Subcripting  from zero creates a disconnect:  ‘T’ is not the first character.        e   s   T   h   l   e   B   a       e   t  s -->

"
">>> s =‘The Beatles’  
>>> t = s[4]

" s2 = ‘Beatles’  
>>> s = s1 + ‘ ‘ + s2  
 
We “added” in a blank.  Types  
 
Strings are a type: str 
 
So at this point we introduced 3 types:  
 
 int   for integers, e.g.,  -12 
 float    for decimals, e.g., 9.12 , -12.0 
 str   for strings, e.g., ‘abc’, ’12.0’ 
 
 
 Python has other built -in types. And we will learn to make up our own types.  A Type is a Set of Values and 
Operations on Them  
  int   123, -123, 0 
 float    1.0, -.00123, -12.3e-5 
 str   ‘abcde’, ‘123.0’  
 
 
 Values…  
The “e” nota"
"tion (a power -of-10 notation)  is handy for very large or very small 
floats.  The literals -.00123 and -12.3e -5 are the same number.  These are called “literals”  A Type is a Set of Values and 
Operations on Them  
  int   +  -  *  /  unary -   **  % 
 float    +  -  *  /  unary -   ** 
 str   +     
 
 
 concatenation  Operations…  Type Conversion  
A string that encodes a decimal value can be  
represented as a float .  >>> s = ‘123.45’  
>>> x = 2*float(s)  
>>> print x  
246.90 
 Type Conversion  
A "
"string that encodes an integer value can  
be represented as an int.  >>> s = ‘ -123’ 
>>> x = 2* int(s) 
>>> print x  
-246 
 Type Conversion  
Shows how to get a string encoding of a  
float value.  >>> x = -123.45 
>>> s = str(x) 
>>> print s  
‘-123.45’ 
 Automatic Type Conversion  
>>> x = 1/2.0  
>>> y = 2*x  
 
An operation between a float  and an int 
results in a float . So x is a float .  
 
Thus,  y is also a float  even though its value 
happens to be an integer.  
 Python is a Dynamically Typed"
" 
Language  
>>> x = ‘ abcde’ 
>>> x = 1.0  
>>> x = 32  
 A variable can hold different types of  
values at different times.  
 
 
In other languages the type of a variable is fixed.  Summary  
1. Variables house values that can be 
accessed.  
 
2. Assignment statements assign values to  
variables.  
 
3. Numerical data can be represented  
using the int and float  types.  
 
4.Text data can be represented using the  
str type.

 Random Walk Simulation  Open -Ended Iteration  
So far, we have only addressed iterative  
problems in which we know (in advance) the  
required number of repetitions.  
 
Not all iteration problems are like that.  
 
Some iteration problems are open -ended.  
Stir for 5 minutes   vs   Stir until fluffy.  Examples

from tile to tile according to a coin flip.  
 
Heads: Hop right one tile.  
 
Tails:  Hop left one tile.

           We do not know in advance how many iterations we’ll need , The While Loop  
We introduce an alternative to the for -"
"loop 
called the while -loop. 
 
The while loop is more flexible and is essential  
for ``open ended’’ iteration.  
 
 
 How Does a While -Loop Work?  
A simple warm -up example:  
 
Sum the first 5 whole numbers and display the  
summation process.  
 
  Two  Solutions  
k = 0  
s = 0 
while k < 5:   
   k = k + 1  
   s = s + k  
   print k,s  
   
s = 0 
for k in range(1,6):          
 s = s + k  
    print k,s 
 The While -Loop Solution  
k = 0  
s = 0 
while k < 5:   
   k = k + 1  
   s = s + k  
   p"
"rint k,s

Observation: k is used for counting,  s is used for the running sum, and the while 
is used to control the repetition of the indented code.   The Solution  
k = 0  
s = 0 
while k < 5:   
   k = k + 1  
   s = s + k

Is the boolean condition true?  
NO! The loop is over.  The While -Loop Mechanism  
while  A Boolean Expression  
 
  The Loop Body   
  :  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
The Boolean expression is checked. If it is true,  
then the loop body is executed. The process is  
repeated until the Boolean expression is false.  
At that point the iteration terminates.  The Broader Context

Indentation defines the loop body   Back to Our Example  
k = 0  
s = 0 
while k < 5:   
   k = k + 1  
   s = s + k  
   print k,s  
 11

36 
410 
515   
 
 
 
 
Let’s move the print statement outside the loop body   Back to Our Example  
k = 0  
s = 0 
while k < 5:   
   k = k + 1  
   s = s + k  
print k,s  
 5  15  
Only the final value of k and s are reported.    
 
 Random Walks

"m Walk Idea  
                                                       
We have a “runway” made up of 1x1 tiles.  
 
There are 2L+1 tiles. (L = 5 in the above.)  
 
We call L the “length of the runway.  
 
The center tile is located at x = 0.

 it encounter an instance of char . If the loop runs to completion,  
that means there is no instance of char .  Boolean Variables  Review: Variables and floats  
It is possible to assign a float value to a  variable:  
 
 a = 1.3 
 b = 10.1  
 c = 3.7 
 r = -b + math.sqrt (b*b-4*a*c))/(2*a)  
  Review: Variables and ints

"tring value to a  
variable:  
 
 m = ‘7’ 
 d = ’4’ 
 y = ‘1776’  
 date = m + ‘/’ + d + ‘/’ + y  
  
  
  Review: Variables and Booleans  
It is possible to assign a boolean  value to a  
variable:  
 
 L = 1 
 R = 2 
 x = 1.3  
 inside = (L<=x) and (x<=R)  
  
  
  Boolean Variables  
 
As the course progresses you will be dealing  
with logical situations that are increasingly 
complicated.  
 
Boolean variables are a handy way of keeping  
track of what is going on.  
  
  
  Example: Leap Year  
 
Greg"
"orian Calendar Rule:  
 
 Y is a leap year if it is a century year that 
 is divisible by 400 or a non -century year

A function can return a boolean  value.  
 
This can be a handy way of encapsulating  
a complicated computation that culminates  
in the production of a True value or a False

They enable you to generate exceptions if  
something is wrong.  
 
A good way to check that your code is  
doing what it should be doing.  
 
A good way to focus on pre - and post - conditions  
during the program development phase.  
 
 
 Assertions: How They Work   
Syntax:     
          assert  B,S    
B is a boolean  expressio"
"n .  
 
S is a string.  
 
If B is not true,  then string S is printed  
and an exception is “raised”.  
 
Otherwise, nothing is done.  Checking Pre -, Post - Conditions  
 
Typical:  
 
     
    1. At the start of a function body, are  
     the preconditions satisfied?  
    2. At the end of the function body, does  
        the value returned have the required  
        properties?

Use assert  and the function isinstance  How isinstance  Works 
It is a boolean -valued function with two arguments.  
 
isinstance (x"
",int)   
  True if variable x houses an int value  
  Otherwise, False  
isinstance (x,float)   
  True if variable x houses a float value  
  Otherwise, False  
isinstance (x,str)   
  True if variable x houses a string value  
  Otherwise, False  
 Using isinstance   
def sqrt(x): 
  assert isinstance (x,float) or 
         isinstance (x,int), 
         print ‘x must be type int or 
                float’ 
    : Guard against the user passing a string to sqrt : The Try-except 
Construction   
A graceful w"
"ay to handle exceptions  Example:Try -Except  
try: 
 
    from AintNoMath  import sqrt 
    print 'AintNoMath.sqrt  unavailable'  
 
except ImportError : 
 
   from math import sqrt 
     print ‘AintNoMath.sqrt  is  not  
             available‘  
 
# Code that uses sqrt... 
a = 9; x = sqrt(a); print a,x 
If the green code triggers an ImportError  exception, then  
the mauve code is executed and “ sqrt” comes from the math 
module. Otherwise sqrt comes from AintNoMath  Try-Except Construction

 Name  of Exception  break break 
Another way to terminate a loop  
 
But it must be used with care for style reasons.  How break Works  
As soon as a break statement is executed  
inside a loop body, the loop ends and the  
n"
"ext statement after the body is executed.  Example  
Compute the smallest N so that N!>10  
fact = 1  
for N in range(1,10000):  
      fact = fact*N  
      if fact>10:  
          print N 
          break 
print fact  Loop range  
big enough 
to ensure  
we will get  
a large  
enough 
factorial  
                                            Recall that   5! = 1 x 2 x 3 x 4 x5  Example  
Print the smallest N so that N!>10  
fact = 1  
for N in range(1,10000):  
      fact = fact*N  
      if fact>10:  
   "
"       print N 
          break 
print fact  
Bad Style! Have to guess a suitable for -loop  range.  While Loop Solution  
Compute the smallest N so that N!>10  
fact = 1  
N = 1 
# fact = N!  
while fact <=10:  
      N = N+1 
      fact = fact*N     
print fact  A Good Example of break  Usage  
Consider the following problem.  
 
A user enters an integer N from the keyboard  
and Python is to display the value of N!  
 
Recall:  5! = 1x2x3x4x5 = 120  
 
Use math.factorial (N) A Good Example of break  Usag"
"e  
Possible issue.  
 
When we use  math.factorial (N), the value 
of N must be nonnegative.  
 
What if the user inputs -5? 
 
Would like to say, “try again”  A Good Example of break Usage  
 
while True:  
   N = raw_input (‘Enter pos int: ’) 
   N = int(N) 
   if N>=0 
      break 
   else: 
      print ‘N must be nonnegative’  
print math.factorial (N) 
                                Keep iterating until a nonnegative int is obtained  Another Issue  
If the user doesn’t enter a string of  
digits then"
" the int statement will crash  
the program:  
 
     N = raw_input (‘Enter pos int: ’) 
  N = int(N) 
 
This brings up the challenge of “exceptions” and  
“exception handling.”  
 A ValueError  Exception  
>>> int('12F') 
ValueError : invalid literal for int()  
    with base 10: '12F'  
Exception a.k.a. run time error  Challenge  
Is there a way we can keep soliciting  
keyboard input until the user enters a  
string of numbers?  
 
Don’t want the program to terminate because  
of a ValueError . The Try-e"

 We Have Seen Lists Before  
MyColor = [.3,.4,.5]  
 
DrawDisk (0,0,1,FillColor = MyColor) Recall that the rgb encoding of a color  
involves a triplet of numbers:  
MyColor   is a list.  
 
A list of numbers is a way of assembling a  
sequence of numbers.  Terminology  
x = [3.0, 5.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3.14]  
How we talk about what i"
"s in a list:  
 
 5.0 is an item in the list x. 
 
 5.0 is an entry  in the list x. 
 
 5.0 is an element  in the list x.  
 
 5.0 is a value  in the list x.  
Get used to the synonyms.  A List Has a Length  
The following would assign the value of 5  
to the variable n:  
x = [3.0, 5.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3.14]  
n = len(x) The Entries in a List are  
 Accessed Using Subscripts  
The following would assign the value of -1.0 
to the variable a: 
x = [3.0, 5.0, -1.0, 0.0, 3.14]  
a = x[2]  A List Can Be Sliced  
Thi"
"s:  x = [10,40,50,30,20]  
y = x[1:3]  
z = x[:3]  
w = x[3:]  
Is same as:  x = [10,40,50,30,20]  
y = [40,50]  
z = [10,40,50]  
w = [30,20]  Lists are Similar to Strings

A string is a sequence of characters.  
  
A list of numbers is a sequence of numbers.  Lists in Python  
Animals = [‘ cat’,’dog’,’mouse ’] Now we consider lists of numbers:  
 
 
 
 
Soon we will consider lists of strings:  
 
 
 
Later  we will consider lists of objects.  
 
The"
" operations on lists that we are about to describe will be illustrated using lists 
of numbers. But they can be applied to any kind of list.  A = [10,20,30]  
B = [10.0,20.0,30.0]  
C = [10,20.0,30]  The items  
in a list  
usually have  
the same type,  
but that is not  
required.  Visualizing Lists

A state diagram that shows  
the “map” from indice"

elements.  Lists vs. Strings  
There are some similarities, e.g., subscripts  
 
But there is a huge difference:  
 
   1. Strings are immutable . They cannot be changed.  
 
   2. Lists are mutable . They can be change.  
 
 
Exactly what does this mean?  Strings are Immutable

When these methods are appl"
"ied to a list,  
they affect the list.  
 
    append 
    extend 
    insert 
    sort 
 
Let’s see what they do through examples…  
 
 
 List Methods: append 
Before:  
x.append (100) 
After:   3   1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             3              4       
100 
Use append when you want to “glue” an item on the end of a given list .  3   1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             3      List Methods: extend 
Before:  
t = [100,200]  
x.extend (t) 
After:   3 "
"  1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             3              4              5       
100  3   1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             3      
200 
Use extend when you want to “glue”  one list onto the end of another list.  List Methods: insert 
Before:  
i = 2 
a = 100 
x.insert (i,a) 
After:   3  100  1   5  x:      0              1              2             3              4                  
 7   3   1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             "
"3      
Use insert when you want to insert an item into the list. Items get “bumped” to  the 
right if they are at or to the right of the specified insertion point.   List Methods: sort 
Before:  
x.sort() 
After:   1   5   3  x:      0              1              2             3                      
 7   3   1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             3      
Use sort when you want to order the elements in a list from little to big.   List Methods: sort 
Before:  
x.sort(reverse=True)  "
"
After:   7   3   5  x:      0              1              2             3                      
 1   3   1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             3      
Use sort when you want to order the elements in a list from big to little.   An optional  
argument is  
being used to  
take care of  
this situation.  Void Methods  
When the methods  
 
 append    extend   insert    sort  
 
 
are applied to a list, they affect the list b ut 
they do not return anything like a number or  
string. "
"They are called “void” methods.  
 
Void methods return the value of None . This is  
Python’s way of saying they do not return  
anything.  
 
 Void Methods  
 
A clarifying example : 
 
 
 
 
 
 >>> x = [10,20,30]  
>>> y = x.append (40) 
>>> print x 
[10, 20, 30, 40]  
>>> print y 
None x.append (40) does 
something to x.  
 
In particular, it appends  
an element to x  
 
It returns None and that is  
assigned to y.  Void Methods/Functions  
The graphics procedures DrawDisk , DrawRect ,  
etc., are exam"
"ples of void functions.  
 
They also return the value None. But we were  
never tempted to do something like this:  
 
  C = DrawDisk (0,0,1) 
 
With lists, however, it is tempting to do  
something like this:  
 
  newValue  = 10 
  y = x.append (newValue ) 
 
So we have to be careful!  
 (Fruitful) List Methods  
When these methods are applied to a list,  
they actually return something:  
 
    pop 
    count 
 
Let’s see what they do through examples…  
 
 
 The List Method  pop 
Before:  
i = 2 
m = x"
".pop( i) 
After:   3   5  x:      0              1              2                               
 7   3   1   7   5  x:      0              1              2             3      
Use pop when you want to remove an element and assign it to a variable.    1  m: The List Method  count 
Before:  
m = x.count(7) 
After:   3   1   7  x:      0              1              2             3                      
 7   3   1   7   7  x:      0              1              2             3      
Use count when  you want to "
"compute the number of items in a list  
that have a value.  m:  2  Two Built -In Functions that  
Can be Applied to Lists

[10,20,30,10,20,30,10,20,30]  Setting Up “Little” Lists  
The examples so far have all been small"
".  
 
When that is the case, the “square bracket”  
notation is just fine for setting up a list:  
x = [10,40,50,30,20]  
Don’t forget the commas!   Working with Big Lists  
Setting up a big list requires a loop.  
 
Looking for things in a big list requires  
a loop.  
 
Let’s consider some examples.  A Big List of Random Numbers  
Roll a dice one million times. Record the outcomes in a list.  from random import randint as randi 
x = [] 
N = 1000000  
for k in range(N):  
    r = randi(1,6) 
    x.append ("
"r) 
 
x starts out as an empty list and is built 
up through repeated appending.  This Does Not Work  
from random import randint as randi 
x = [] 
N = 1000000  
for k in range(N):  
    r = randi(1,6) 
    x[k] = r  
 
x[k] = r  
IndexError : list assignment index out of range  
x[0] = r   does not work because x is the empty list —it has no components  A List of Square Roots  
from math import sqrt 
x = [] 
N = 1000000  
for k in range(N):  
    s = sqrt(k) 
    x.append (s) 
 
Same idea. Create a list th"
"rough repeated appending.  A Random Walk Example  
from random import randint as randi 
x = [0] 
k = 0 
# x[k] is robot’s location after k hops  
while abs(x[k])<=10:  
    # Flip a coin and hop right or left  
    r = randi(1,2) 
    if r==1:  
        new_x = x[k]+1  
    else: 
        new_x = x[k]-1 
    k = k+1 
    x.append (new_x) A Random Walk Example  
from random import randint as randi 
x = [0] 
k = 0 
# x[k] is robot’s location after k hops  
while abs(x[k])<=10:  
    # Flip a coin and hop righ"
"t or left  
    r = randi(1,2) 
    if r==1:  
        new_x = x[k]+1  
    else: 
        new_x = x[k]-1 
    k = k+1 
    x.append (new_x) Notice  
that x is  
initialized  
as a  
length -1 
list. The  
robot  
starts  
at the  
origin .  
 Be Careful About Types  
This is OK and synonymous with x = [0,10]:  
 
         x = [0] 
 x.append (10) 
 
This is not OK : 
 
         x = 0 
 x.append (10) 
 
AttributeError : 'int' object has  
     no attribute 'append'  You need the square  
brackets. It is your"
" way  
of telling Python that  
X   is a list, not an int.  Be Careful About Types  
>>> x = 0  
>>> type(x)  
<type 'int'>  
>>> x = [0]  
>>> type(x)  
<type 'list'>  Functions and Lists  
Let’s start with a function that returns a list.  
 
In particular, a function that returns a  
list of random integers from a given  
interval.  
 
Then we will use that function to estimate  
various probabilities when a pair of dice are  
rolled.  A List of Random Integers  
from random import randint as randi 
 
def"
" randiList (L,R,n): 
    “““ Returns a length -n list of  
    random integers from interval [L,R]  
    PreC: L,R,n ints with L<=R and n>=1  
    ””” 
    x = [] 
    for k in range(n):  
        r = randi(L,R) 
        x.append (r)  
    return x  
 Outcomes from Two Dice Rolls  
Roll a pair of dice N times  
 
Store the outcomes of each dice roll  
in a pair of length -N lists.  
 
Then using those two lists, create a third  
list that is the sum of the outcomes  
in another list.  
  Outcomes from Two D"
"ice Rolls  
Example:   
 2   5   4   1  D1:      0              1              2             3      
 3   4   2   3  D2:      0              1              2             3      
 5   9   6   4   D:      0              1              2             3      How to Do It  
N = 1000000  
D1 = randiList (1,6,N) 
D2 = randiList (1,6,N) 
 
D = [] 
for k in range(N):  
   TwoThrows  = D1[k] + D2[k]

"17. Dictionaries  
Topics:  
 Basic dictionary manipulations  
 How they are different from lists  
 Dictionaries are Objects  
 Application: Word frequency  
 A First Example  
 
 D = {‘I’:1,’V’:5,’X’:10,’L’:50,’C’:100}  
 
This dictionary has 5 items : 
 
   ’I’:1 
   ’V’:5 
   ’X’:10 
   ’L’:50 
   ’C’:100  
 Keys and Values  
 
 D = {‘I’:1,’V’:5,’X’:10,’L’:50,’C’:100}  
 
An item has a key and a value . 
 
For the item  ’V’:5 
 
           ‘V’ is the key  
            5  is the value  
    Set-Up 
 
 D "
"= {‘I’:1,’V’:5,’X’:10,’L’:50,’C’:100}  
 
To set up a small dictionary in this style you do 
this: 
 
1. Use a colon to separate a key from its value.  
 
2. Separate items with a comma.  
 
3. Enclose the whole thing with curly brackets.  
    The Methods .keys and .values 
 
 >>> D = 
{'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100}  
 
>>> D.keys() 
['I', 'X', 'C', 'L', 'V']  
 
>>> D.values () 
[1, 10, 100, 50, 5]  
 Creates a list  
of all the keys  
Creates a list  
of  all the values  Deleting a Dictionary Item  "

>>> D = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50,'C':100}  
 
>>> del D[‘X’]  
 
>>> D 
{'I':1,'V':5,'L':50,'C':100}  Some Questions  
How do you check if a dictionary has a key?  
 
How do you access items in a dictionary?  
 
How can you add an item to a dictionary?  
 
How is a dictionary different from a list?  
 
Are there type -related rules about keys?  
 
Are there type -related rules about values?  Checking to see if a Dictionary 
Has a Particular Key  
>>> D = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10}  
>>> 'I' in D  
Tr"
"ue 
>>> 'II' in D  
False 
>>> 
Use  in to check if a dictionary has a particular 
key. Checking if D has a particular  
Value Using the values  Method  
>>> D = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10}  
>>> L = D.values () 
>>> L 
[1, 10, 5]  
>>> 5 in L  
True Use “in” on  
that list  Produce a list  
of all the values  
in D Extracting a Value  
>>> D = {'I':1,'V': 5,'X':10}  
>>> a = D[‘V’]  
>>> a 
5 
Use square bracket notation.  
 
Use the key as you would an integer subscript.  Adding an Item to a Dictionary  
>>> D ="
" {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10}  
>>> D['C'] = 100  
>>> D 
{'I': 1, 'X': 10, 'C': 100, 'V': 5}  
Use assignment, e.g.,  D['C'] = 100  
 
This “connects” the assigned value to the key 
named within square brackets making the pair  
an item, e.g., 'C': 100  
 Changing the Value of an Item  
>>> D = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10}  
>>> D[‘V'] = 55  
>>> D 
{'I':1, 'X':10, 'V':55}  
 D[‘V'] = 55  does not produce  
 
   {'I':1, ‘V’:5, 'X':10, 'V':55}  
 
Cannot have two items with the same key.  
 Dictionaries are Different

" Lists  
>>> D = {'I':1,'V':5,'X':10,'L':50}  
 
>>> D  
{'I': 1, 'X': 10, 'L': 50, 'V': 5}  
The items in a dictionary are not ordered as in a  
list. 
 
We see here that Python “shows” a different  
ordering than how D was set up.  Dictionaries are Different 
From Lists  
>>> D = {'I': 1, 'X': 10, 'V': 5}

Trying to access a nonexistent item.  
 
Note: D[‘L’] = 50  is legal and adds an item to D                             A Dictionary Application  
Given a text file F that encodes (for example)  
an English novel,  create a dictionary  D that 
specifies the frequency of each word that  "
"
appears in the file.   
 
 Word Frequency Dictionaries  
The dictionary  
 
       D = {‘sun’:34,‘moon’:5,’darcy’:56}  
 
would “say” that there are  
  
  34  occurrences of ‘sun’,  
  5  occurrences of ‘moon’, and  
  56  occurrences of ‘ darcy ’. 
 
 Strategy  
First, read the file and create a list of strings,  
one string for each line in the file:

Looks Like

"s:  
They Elevate the Level Thinking  
>>> P = Point(2,1)  
>>> Q = Point(6,4)  
>>> d = P.Dist(Q) 
>>> print d  
5 (2,1) (6,4) 
Here, Dist  is a method and P.Dist(Q) 
says “compute and return the distance from  
point P to point Q.  >>> P = Point(2,1)  
>>> Q = Point(6,4)  
>>> d = P.Dist(Q) 
>>> print d  
5 (2,1) (6,4) 
By having a  Point  class we can think at the  
 “point level” instead of at the “ xy level”  One Reason for classes:  
They Elevate the Level Thinking  Classes and Types  
Recall that a t"
"ype is a set of values and  
operations that can be performed on those values.  
 
The four basic “built -in” types:  
 
                   int, float, str, bool 
 
Classes are a way to define new types.  
 
 Examples  
By suitably defining a rectangle class, we could  
say something like  
 
if R1.intersect(R2):  
  print ‘Rectangles R1 and R2 intersect’  
 
 Examples  
By suitably defining a  polynomial class, we  
could perform operations like  
 
             p = q + r  
 
where q and r are polynomials "
"that are  
added together to produce a polynomial p  
 
 
 How to Define a Class  A Point  Class

that the air temperature is T = 32F and the wind  
is W = 20mph.

What is the new windchill  if the win"
"d is  
increased from 20mph to 30mph?  
 
Looks like we have to type in the same  
sequence of statements. Tedious.  
 
Wouldn’t it be nice if we could store the  
sequence of statements in a file and then have  
Python “run the file” after we changed  
Wind = 20  to Wind = 30  ?   Script Mode  
Instead of running Python in interactive mode , 
we run Python in  script mode . 
 
The code to be run (called a script ) is entered  
into a file (called a module ). 
 
We then ask Python to “run the script”.  What"
" is a Module?  
 
A module  is a  .py  file that contains Python code.

 We will develop a graphics procedure that 
draws this:  
The procedure will call itself.  We are tiling  
a triangle with  
increasingly

triangles.  Tiling a Triangle  
We start  
with one

And are to  
end up with  
this: Tiling a Triangle

colorList = [cyan,magenta,yellow]  
r = randi(0,2)

L W The Procedure Mondrian  
A couple of feature"
"s  
to make the design more  
interesting:  
 
(1)The dart throw that  
determines the subdivision  
can’t land too near the edge.  
No super skinny tiles!  
 
(2) Randomly decide  
whether or not to subdivide.  
This creates a nice diversity  
in size.  Overall Conclusions  
Recursion is sometimes the simplest way  
to organize a computation.  
 
It would be next to impossible to do the  
triangle tiling problem any other way.  
 
On the other hand, factorial computation  
is easier via for -loop iteration"
".   Overall Conclusions  
Infinite recursion (like infinite loops) can  
happen so careful reasoning is required.  
 
Will we reach the “base case”?  
 
Graphics examples: We will reach Level==0  
Factorial:                We will reach n==1

We now have two ways to search a list:  
 
  LinSearch (x,a) 
  BinSearch (x,a) 
 
Intuition: BinSearch  much faster.  
 
Can we quantify this with a “stop watch”?  The timeit  Module  
This module can be used to time how  
long "
"it takes to execute a chunk of code.  
 
Typical chunk = some function of interest.  
 
This is called benchmarking.  
 Benchmarking  
Let’s benchmark LinSearch (x,a) and  
BinSearch (x,a). 
 
Compare how long it takes when len(a)  equals   
1000, 10000, 100000, and 1000000.  
 
Our intuition tells us that as len(a) increases,  
BinSearch  will be dramatically faster.  BinSearch  vs LinSearch  
    n       tBin     tLin      tLinW

1000000    0.0015  17.7388   13.9341  
 
 tBin  = time for BinSearch  
tLin  = time for LinSearch  (for loop version)  
tLinW = time for LinSearch  (while-loop version)  BinSearch  vs LinSearch  
    n       tLin/tBin

 100000       754     
1000000      7095    
 
 
Reporting ratios is more illuminating since we do not really  
care a"
"bout the time units in this informal comparison  Using the timeit  Module  
We show how this module was use to  
get the results on the previous slides.  
 
Our LinSearch  vs BinSearch  example is very  
typical: is one function faster than another?

Binary Search is an example of a “divide  
and conquer” approach top probkem  solving.  
 
A method for sorting a list that features  
this  strategy is MergeSort  Motivation  
You are asked to sort a list but you  have  
two “helpers”:  H"
"1 and H2.  
 
Idea:   
 
 1. Split the list in half and have each 
helper sort one of the halves.  
 
 2. Then merge the two sorted lists into  
 a single larger list.  
This idea can be repeated if H1 has two helpers  
and H2 has two helpers.   Subdivide the Sorting Task

  All Done!   Some Conclusions  
Infinite recursion (like infinite loops) can  
happen so careful reasoning is required.  
 
Will we reach the “base case”?  
 
In MergeSort , a recursive call always  
involves"
" a list that is shorter than the input  
list. So eventually we reach the len(a)==1  
base case.

If there is a tie, then compare their ranks:

 Motivation  
 The numpy  Module  
 Subscripting  
 functions and 2d Arrays  
 
 Visualizing  
A 2D array has rows and columns.  
 
This one has 3 rows and 4 columns.  
 
We say it is a “3 -by-4” array ( a.k.a matrix)  12 17 49 61 
38 18 82 77 
83 53 12 10 Can have a 2d array  
of strings or  
objects.  
 
But we will just  
deal with 2d arrays  
of numbers.  Rows and Columns  
This is row 1.  12 17 49 61 
38 18 82 77 
83 53 12 10 Rows and Columns  
This is column 2.  1"

83 53 12 10 Entries  
This is the (1,2) entry.  12 17 49 61 
38 18 82 77 
83 53 12 10 Where Do They Come From?  
Entry ( i,j) is the distance from city i to city j  
Where  Do they Come From?  
Entry ( i,j) is 1 if node i is connected to  
node j and is 0 otherwise  
Captures the connectivity in  
a network       
      Nodes  
4 and 6  
Are

An m -by-n array  
of pixels.  
 
Each pixel encodes  
3 numbers: a red value,  
a green value, a blue  "
"
value  
 
So all the information  
can be encoded in three  
2D arrays  
2d Arrays in Python  
A = [[12,17,49,61],[38,18,82,77],[83,53,12,10]]  
A list of lists.  12 17 49 61 
38 18 82 77 
83 53 12 10 Accessing Entries  
A = [[12,17,49,61],[38,18,82,77],[83,53,12,10]]  A[1][2] 12 17 49 61 
38 18 82 77 
83 53 12 10 Accessing Entries  
A = [[12,17,49,61],[38,18,82,77],[83,53,12,10]]  A[2][1] 12 17 49 61 
38 18 82 77 
83 53 12 10 Setting Up 2D Arrays  
def zeros( m,n): 
    v = [] 
    for k in range(n):  
  "
"      v.append (0.0) 
    A = [] 
    for k in range(m):  
        A.append (v) 
    return A  
 Here is a function that returns a reference to  
an m-by-n array of zeros:  Python is Awkward  
Turns out that base Python is not very handy  
for 2D array manipulations.  
 
The numpy  module makes up for this.  
 
We will learn just enough numpy  so that  
we can do elementary plotting, image  
processing and other things.  
 
 Introduction to 2D Arrays  
in numpy  
A few essentials illustrated  
by examples. "
" Setting up a 2D Array of 0’s  
>>> from numpy import *  
>>> m = 3  
>>> n = 4  
>>> A = zeros((m,n))  
>>> A 
array([[ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],  
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.],  
       [ 0.,  0.,  0.,  0.]])  
Note how the row and column dimensions are passed to zeros  Accessing an Entry  
>>> A = zeros((3,2))  
>>> A[2,1] = 10  
>>> A 
array([[  0.,   0.],  
       [  0.,   0.],  
       [  0.,  10.]])  
A nicer notation than A[2][1].  Accessing an Entry  
>>> A = array([[1,2,3],[4,5,6]])  
>>> A 
array([[1, 2"
", 3],  
       [4, 5, 6]])  
Using the array constructor to build a  
3-by-2 array. Note all the square brackets.  Use Copy to Avoid Aliasing  
>>> A = array([[1,2],[3,4]])  
>>> B = A  
>>> A[1,1] = 10  
>>> B 
array([[ 1,  2],  
       [ 3, 10]])  2D arrays are  
objects  >>> A = array([[1,2],[3,4]])  
>>> B = copy(A)  
>>> A[1,1] = 10  
>>> B

    Reminder that Indentation Is  
Important  
If x is even, then the code on the left will print the value of x/2 while the code  
on the right will print the value of x/2 twice (on separate lines).  if x%2==0:

Solution:  
Want:    ‘carry’   to become   ‘carries’         
Use string slicing and concatenation:     ‘ carr’ + ‘ies’ A Modified Problem  
If the last character in a 5 -character  
string  s  is  ’y’, then  
       1. change the ‘ y’ to  ‘i’  
       2. add ‘es’  
       3. assign the result to a variable plural .   
Otherw"
"ise , just add  ‘ s’ and assign the  
       result to a variable plural . 
         
This will require the if -else construction.  Solution  
if s[4]==‘y’:  
   plural = s[0:4] + ’ ies’ 
else: 
   plural = s + ‘s’  
print s,plural  
Remember: s[0:4] names the substring comprised of the first 4 characters.  Discussion of Solution  
if s[4]==‘y’: 
   plural = s[0:4] + ’ ies’ 
else: 
   plural = s + ‘s’  
print s,plural  
A new comparison is being used.  
 
If you want to check to see if two expressions have "
" 
      the same value, use  == .  
 
Why? If you say s[4]=‘y’ it looks like an assignment.  
    Discussion of Solution  
if s[4]==‘y’: 
   plural = s[0:4] + ’ ies’ 
else: 
   plural = s + ‘s’

The print statement is executed after the if -else  
is processed. E.g.

Thus, 1960, 2000 and 2400 are leap years. 1961 and 1900 are not. This code  
assigns the value of True  to LeapYear  if Y encodes a leap year. It assigns the 
value of False  to LeapYear  if Y does not encode a leap year.  A Summarizing Example  
Input a string. If it has even length, then  
hyphenate in the middle:  
 
                baseball          base -ball 
 
If it "
"has odd length, then hyphenate around the  
middle character:  
       
               frisbee             fri-s-bee The len Function  
If ever you need to compute the length of  
a string then use the built -in function len. 
s = ‘abcdef’ 
n = len(s) 
m = n/2 
First = s[:m]  
Second = s[m:]       x ---> ‘abcdef ’ 
  6   
 3  
‘def’  ‘abc’      n ---> 
     m ---> 
Second ---> First ---> The len Function  
If ever you need to compute the length of  
a string then use the built -in function len. 
s = ‘abcdef"
"g’ 
n = len(s)

First = s[:m]  
Second = s[m:]       x ---> ‘abcdefg ’

Second ---> First ---> So Let’s Solve this Problem  
Input a string. If it has even length, then  
hyphenate in the middle:  
 
                baseball          base -ball 
 
If it has odd length, then hyphenate around the  
middle character:  
       
               frisbee             fri-s-bee Developing a Solution  
Instead of just showing the solution, let’s  
“derive” t"
"he solution using a methodology  
that is called stepwise refinement . 
The course is really about problem solving with the computer.  
So developing problem -solving strategies is VERY IMPORTANT  “Reformat” the task.  
Read in the string  
Compute its length  
if the length is even  
    Hyphenate in the middle  
else 
    Hyphenate around around the middle  
    character.  
Still in English, but it looks a little more like python.  “Reformat” the task.  
Read in the string  
Compute its length  
if the l"
"ength is even  
    Hyphenate in the middle  
else 
    Hyphenate around around the middle  
    character.  
Turn these into Python   
 Refine  
s = input(‘Enter a string: ‘)  
n = len(s) 
if the length is even  
    Hyphenate in the middle  
else 
    Hyphenate around around the middle  
    character.  
We have turned the first two lines into python.  Refine Some More  
s = input(‘Enter a string: ‘)  
n = len(s) 
if the length is even  
    Hyphenate in the middle  
else 
    Hyphenate around around the "
"middle  
    character.  
How do we check if the value in n is even?                                                                     Refine Some More  
h = input(‘Enter a string: ‘)  
n = len(s) 
if n%2==0:  
   # s has even length  
    Hyphenate in the middle  
else: 
    # s has odd length  
    Hyphenate around around the middle  
    character.  
We add comments to summarize what we may assume about the value of n.  Refine Some More  
h = input(‘Enter a string: ‘)  
n = len(s) 
if n%2==0:  
   # s "
"has even length  
    Hyphenate in the middle  
else: 
    # s has odd length  
    Hyphenate around around the middle  
    character.                                                  
Figure out the even -length hyphenation  Even-Length Hyphenation  
We look at a small example.  
These statements  
    s = ‘abcdef’ 
    h = s[0:3] + ‘ -’ + s[3:]  
 assign ‘abc-def’ to h. 
 
In general:  
        m = n/2 
     h = s[0:m] + ‘ -’ + s[m:]  
  
 Refine Some More  
h = input(‘Enter a string: ‘)  
n = len(s) 
if"
" n%2==0:  
   # s has even length  
  m = n/2 
     h = s[0:m] + ‘ -’ + s[m:]  
else: 
    # s has odd length  
    Hyphenate around around the middle  
    character.   
 Refine Some More  
h = input(‘Enter a string: ‘)

    character.   
 
Figure out the odd -length hyphenation  Odd-Length Hyphenation  
We look at a small example.  
This 
 "
"s = ‘abcdefg’ 
 h = s[0:3] + ‘ -’ + s[3] + ‘ -’ + s[3:]  
 assigns ‘abc-d-efg’ to h. 
 
In general:  
    m = n/2 
 h = s[0:m] + ‘ -’ + s[m] + ‘ -’+ s[m+1:]  
  
 Done!  
h = input(‘Enter a string: ‘)  
n = len(s) 
if n%2==0:  
    # s has even length  
    m = n/2 
    h = s[0:m] + ‘ -’ + s[m:]  
else: 
    # s has odd length  
        m = n/2 
    h = s[0:m]+‘ -’+s[m]+‘ -’+s[m+1:]

"4. Modules and Functions  
Topics:  
 
 Modules  
 Using import 
 Using functions from  math  
 A first look at defining functions  
 
 
 The Usual Idea of a Function  
 
 
 
          sqrt 
 
 9 3 
A factory that has inputs and builds outputs.  Why are Functions So Important?  
One reason is that they hide detail and  
enable us to think at a higher level.  
 
Who wants to think about how to 
compute square roots in a calculation that  
involves other more challenging things?  
 
r = (sqrt(250+110* sqrt(5)"
")/20)*E  The Process of Implementation  
To implement  a function is to package a  
computational idea in a way that others  
can use it.  
 
We use the example of square root to  
illustrate this.  It Starts with an Insight  
The act of computing the square root  
of a number  x is equivalent to building a  
square whose area is x.  
 
If you can build that square and measure  
its side, then you have sqrt(x). Making a Given Rectangle  
“More Square”  
L  x/L = W  
How can we make this rectangle “ more squ"
"are ”  
while preserving its area?  Observation  
If the square and rectangle  have area x,  then  
we see that  the sqrt(x) is in between L and W . Recipe for an Improved L  
L x/L 
L = (L+x/L)/2      
x/L L 
Take the  
average of the  
length and width  Repeat and Package  
x L L = x 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
In comes x, the “raw material”.  
A square root is fabricated and shipped.  Repeat and Package  
x L L = x 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
L = (L+x/L)"
"/2 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
L = (L+x/L)/2 
How do we make something like        in Python?  
 
We talk about “built in” functions first.      Talking About Functions  
A function has a name and arguments.  
m = max( x,y) 
name  arguments  
We say that   max(x,y) is a function call . Built-in Functions  
 
The list of “built -in” Python functions  is quite 
short.  
 
Here are some of the ones that require  
numerical arguments:  
 
                  max,  min, abs, round  
   
 
 
 abs(-6) is 6       max( -3,2) is 2"
"       min(9, -7) is -7 
round(6.3) is 6.0    round(3.5) is 4.0    round( -6.3) is -6.0  Calling  Functions  
 
>>> a = 5  
>>> b = 7  
>>> m = max(a** b,b**a) 
>>> diff = abs( a**b–b**a)                   
 
In a function call, arguments can be expressions.  
Thus, the value of the expression  a**b–b**a 
is passed as an argument to abs. Functions in Mathematics vs 
Functions in Python  
 
So far our examples look like the kind of  
functions that we learn about in math.  
 
 “In comes one or more numbers a"
"nd out  
 comes a number.”  
 
However, the concept is more general in  
computing as we will see throughout the course.  
  
 
 >>> a = 5  
>>> b = 6  
>>> c = 7  
>>> d = 8  
>>> m = max(a** d,d**a,b**c,c**b) 
>>> n = max(a*b*c*d,500)  The Number of Arguments is  
Sometimes Allowed to Vary  
The max function can have an arbitrary number of arguments   The Built -In Function len 
A function can have a string argument.  >>> s = ‘ abcde’ 
>>> n = len(s) 
>>> print n  
5 
“In comes a string and out comes its "
"length (as an int)”   Functions and Type  
Sometimes a function only accepts arguments of  
a certain type. E.g., you cannot pass an int 
value to the function len: 
>>> x = 10  
>>> n = len(x) 
TypeError : Object of the type int 
                has no len() Functions and Type  
On the other hand, sometimes a function is  
designed to be flexible regarding the type  
of values it accepts:  
>>> x = 10  
>>> y = 7.0  
>>> z = max( x,y) 
Here, max is returning the larger of two values  
and it does not care "
"if one has type int and the  
other has type float.  Type -Conversion  Functions  
Three important built -in functions convert types:  
int, float , and str. 
 
 >>> a = float(22)/float(7)  
>>> a 
3.142857142857143  
>>> b = int(100*a) 
>>> b 
314 
>>> c = '100*pi = ' + str(b) 
>>> c 
'100*pi = 314'  
        Some Obvious Functions are not 
in the “Core” Python Library!  
>>> x = 9  
>>> y = sqrt(x) 
NameError : name ‘ sqrt’ not defined  
 
How can we address this issue?  Modules  
A way around this is to "
"import  functions (and  
other things you may need) from “modules” that  
have been written by experts.  
 
Recall that a module  is a file that contains  
Python code.  
 
That file can include functions that can be  
imported for your use.  Widely -Used Modules  
A given Python installation typically comes  
equipped with a collection of standard modules  
that can be  routinely accessed.  
 
Here are some that we will use in CS 1110:  
 
  math  numpy urllib2 
  string scipy PIL 
  random timeit datetime"
"  
 
 The CS1110  Plan for Learning 
about Functions in Python  
1. Practice  using the math  module. Get solid with 
the import mechanism.  
 
2. Practice  using the SimpleMath  module. Get 
solid with how functions are defined.  
 
3. Practice  designing and using your own “math -
like” functions.  The Plan Cont’d  
4. Practice  using the SimpleGraphics  module. 
Get solid using procedures that produce 
graphical output.  
 
5. Practice  using methods from the string class.  
 
6. Practice using simple cl"
"asses as a way to solid 
with methods that can be applied to objects.  
   (Several weeks away.)  
 Procedures and Methods are special types of functions.  The Plan Cont’d  
Over the entire semester we keep revisiting the  
key ideas to see how they play out in more  
complicated situations.  
 
All along the way we develop skills for  
  1.  Designing Functions  
  2. Testing Functions

 import  
MyModule.py  If you want  to use the square root function  
from the math module, then it must be imported:  Useful functions in  math 
ceil(x)   the sm"
"allest integer >= x  
floor(x)   the largest integer <= x  
sqrt(x)  the square root of x  
exp(x)   e**x where e = 2.7182818284…  
log(x)   the natural logarithm of x  
log10(x)   the base -10 logarithm of x  
sin(x)   the sine of x (radians)  
cos(x)  the cosine of x (radians)  
 Legal:   from math import sin,cos,exp,log    math.floor , math.ceil , 
round, int 
Let’s look at what these functions do and  
the type of the value that  they return.

 Finding Out What’s in a Module?  
If a module is part of your Python installation,  
then you can find out what it contains like this:  
 
>>> help(‘random’)  
But if the module is “famous” (like all the ones  
we will be using), then just Google it.  
 
 
 What’s in a"
" Module?  
If you  know the name of a particular function  
and want more information:  
 
>>> help(‘ math.sqrt ’) 
What’s With the “dot” Notation:   math.sqrt ?   from math import *  
        : 
r = (sqrt(250+110* sqrt(5))/20)*E  
x = cos(pi*log(r)) 
        : Need Stuff from a Module? 
Method 1  
MyModule.py  
This is handy. You now have permission to use everything  
in the math module by its name.  However, this can open the 
door to name conflict if the imported module is big like math.   import math  "
"
        : 
r = (math.sqrt (250+110* math.sqrt (5))/20)*E  
x = math.cos (math.pi*math.log (r)) 
        : Need Stuff from a Module?  
Method 2.  
MyModule.py  
You again have permission to use everything in the math 
module by its name.  But you must use its “full name” and that  
involves  using the “dot notation.”    from math import sqrt, pi, cos, log 
        : 
r = (sqrt(250+110* sqrt(5))/20)*E  
x = cos(pi*log(r)) 
        : Need Stuff from a Module?  
Method 3.  
MyModule.py  
Here you take only wha"
"t you need from the source module.  
You get to use “nice” names without using the dot notation. 
The danger of name conflicts minimized because you are 
explicitly aware of what is imported.   Appreciating “Full Names”   
import M1  
import M2  
import M3    
     :         
 
 
 
 
                            
 
 
 
 
                            
 
 
 
 
                    Your code                      M1     M2     M3    
Unambiguous names in your code even if some  
of the module functions have the sa"
"me name.     Appreciating “Full Names”   
from M1 import *  
from M2 import *  
from M3 import *    
     :         
 
 
 
 
                            
 
 
 
 
                            
 
 
 
 
                    Your code                      M1     M2     M3    
Now function calls in your code can be ambiguous.  
Easy to lose track of things if M1, M2, and M3 
include tons of functions . Appreciating “Full Names”   
from M1 import f1  
from M2 import f2  
from M3 import f2    
     :         
 
 
 
"
" 
                            
 
 
 
 
                            
 
 
 
 
                    Your code                      M1     M2     M3    
Selective importing is ok since you are “on top of”  
exactly what is being imported. And you can  
use the short name, e.g., f1 instead of M1.f1 The time has come to see how functions are  
actually defined.  
 
To do this we introduce a small “classroom”  
module that we call SimpleMath . Building Your Own Functions   Visualizing SimpleMath.py  
Recall that  
"
"a module is  
simply a . py file 
that contains  
Python code.  
 
This particular  
module houses 
three functions:  
sqrt , sin, and cos SimpleMath.py  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                  sqrt 
sin  
cos  How are Functions Defined?  
 I can drive a car without knowing what is under the hood.    Let’s look at the three function definitions  
in SimpleMath  not worrying (for now) about  
their inner workings.  
 
This plays nicely with the following fact:  
you can use a function without understanding  
how it"
" works.  
 A Square Root Function  
The function  
header begins  
with def. 
 
It indicates the  
name of the  
function and  
its arguments.  
 
Note the colon  
and indentation.  def sqrt(x): 
    x = float(x)  
    L = x  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    return L                                      A Square Root Function  
This is the body of 
the function.  
 
It computes a value 
L (hopefully a good 
square root.)  
 
T"
"he calling program 
will be informed of 
this value because  
of the return 
statement.  def sqrt(x): 
    x = float(x)  
    L = x  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    return L   
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
                                                    The Cosine and Sine Functions  
def cos(x): 
    x = float(x)  
    y = 1.0-(x**2/2)+(x**4/24) -(x**6/720)  
    return y  
def sin(x):  
    x = float(x)  
    y = x-(x**3/6)+(x**5/12"
"0) -(x**7/5040)  
    return y  
They too have headers  
 DO NOT WORRY ABOUT THE MATH. THIS IS ABOUT THE STRUCTURE  
OF PYTHON FUNCTIONS    The Cosine and Sine Functions  
def cos(x): 
    x = float(x)  
    y = 1.0-(x**2/2)+(x**4/24) -(x**6/720)  
    return y  
def sin(x):  
    x = float(x)  
    y = x-(x**3/6)+(x**5/120) -(x**7/5040)  
    return y  
They too have bodies  Fruitful Functions  
All three of these functions are fruitful  
functions.  
 
Fruitful functions return a value.  
 
Not all functi"
"ons are like that.  
 
We will discuss the mechanics of how fruitful  
functions return values later.  Making Functions Usable  
Again, the great thing about functions in 
programming is that you can use a function 
without understanding how it works.  
However, for this to be true the author(s) of 
the function must communicate how -to-use 
information through docstrings  and comments. 
There are rules for doing this . Rule 1. The Module Starts With  
Authorship Comments

# January 2, 2016  
"""""" Module to illustrate three simple  
math-type functions.

 Procedures  
We continue our introduction to functions 
with a focus on procedures.  
 
Procedures are functions that do not 
return a value.  
 
Instead, they  “do something.”  
 
Graphics is a good place to illustrate the 
idea. 
 
  
 The Module SimpleGraphics  
Has Eight Procedures  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
"
" 
 MakeWindow  
ShowWindow  
DrawRect  
DrawDisk  
DrawStar  SimpleGraphics.py  
We will use this  
module to make  
designs that  
involve  
rectangles,  
disks , stars, etc  DrawLineSeg  
Title DrawText  Examples  
Looks like we will be able to draw tilted rectangles  Example  
How  
does  
color  
work?  What  
if we  
had  
100 rows  
each with  
100 stars ?  
Anticipating loops.   Example  
Xeno’s  Paradox: Will we ever reach the right edge?   Example  
White Rectangle + Red Rectangle + White Disk + Re"
"d Disk +  Tilted White Star   Example  
Let’s write a function to draw this:  
And then apply it two times:  
Functions calling other functions.   
After We Learn About Iteration…  
What if there were billions and billions of stars? Will need loops.   After We Learn About Iteration…  
How long before the square is covered? Need loops.   After We Learn About Recursion…  
Random Mondrian. Repeatedly cut a rectangle into 4 smaller rectangles.   
We now show how to use the eight procedures 
in SimpleGraphics : "

  DrawText  
        Title 
 A Quick Tour Through the 
SimpleGraphics  Module  
Each of these  
procedures has several  
“options.” We do not  
cover everything in the  
lecture slides. Labs and  
demo scripts cover 
these procedures in 
greater detail.  
 First: Create a Figure Window   
You cannot create any designs until you  
have a figure into which you can “drop”  
rectangles, disks, and stars.  
 MakeWindow  
from"
" SimpleGraphics  import *  
n = 5 
MakeWindow (n) 
Here we have created  
a figure with labeled axes  
that is ready to display  
things in the square defined  
by  
 -5<=x<=+5, -5<=y<=5  
 MakeWindow  
from SimpleGraphics  import* 
n = 5 
MakeWindow (n,bgcolor =PURPLE)  
The “default” is to “paint”  
the figure window white.  
 
So this is what you must  
do to set the background  
color to something  
different.  
 
 
 
MakeWindow  
from SimpleGraphics  import* 
n = 5 
MakeWindow (n,labels =False) 
The “d"
"efault” is to label  
the axes.  
 
So this is what you must  
do to suppress the  
labeling.  
 
 
 
We are using import * to save space and because it is such a tiny module.   Color in simpleGraphics  
The module has thirteen “built -in” colors.  
 
If a SimpleGraphics  procedure wants a color,  
just “hand over” one of these:  
 
YELLOW PURPLE CYAN  ORANGE 
RED  BLUE  GREEN MAGENTA 
PINK  WHITE BLACK  LIGHTGRAY  
   DARKGRAY  
There is more flexibility than this. More later.   MakeWindow  
from SimpleGra"
"phics  import* 
n = 5 
MakeWindow (n,labels =False,bgcolor =ORANGE)  
You can turn off labeling  
and specify a color  
in the same call to  
MakeWindow . 
 
Optional Arguments  
The function MakeWindow  has four arguments.  
 
Three of the arguments are “optional”.  
 
When there are several optional arguments,  
their order is immaterial. These are equivalent:  
 
  MakeWindow (n,labels =False,bgcolor =ORANGE)  
  MakeWindow (n,bgcolor =ORANGE,labels =False)  
 
 
Note: You need the “assignment” for an op"
"tional argument.  
  This is illegal: MakeWindow (5,False,ORANGE)  Let’s Draw a Rectangle  
with DrawRect  
You must tell DrawRect   
 
       - the center of the rectangle.  
       - the horizontal dimension of the rectangle  
 - the vertical dimension of the rectangle  
 
You have the option of telling DrawRect   
 
 - the fill color  
 - the width of the perimeter highlight  
 - the color of the perimeter highlight  
 - the rotation angle

The default is a rectangle  
with no fill color. So all you  
get is the perimeter.

actually displayed

is executed. More  
later.  DrawRect

MakeWindow (5,bgcolor=YELLOW)  
x=0; y=0; L=5; W=3

"or=YELLOW)  
x=0; y=0; L=5; W=3  
DrawRect (x,y,L,W,FillColor =MAGENTA,EdgeWidth =6) 
ShowWindow () 
Use the optional EdgeWidth  
argument to specify the  
boldness of the perimeter  
highlight. The default  
is EdgeWidth  = 1 
 
If you don’t want any perimeter highlight, set EdgeWidth =0 DrawRect

argument to specify the  
counterclockwise r"

center. (Angle in degrees.)

"s Draw This  
Rules:  
 
Big circle center at ( -4,0)  
with radius 4.  
 
Circles are tangent  to each  
other. Centers  on x -axis. 
 
Each circle has half the  
radius of its left neighbor.  Draw the First Disk  
x = -4 
r = 4 
DrawDisk (x,0,r,FillColor= MAGENTA,EdgeWidth =0) 
Draw the Second Disk  
x = x + 1.5*r  
r = r/2 
DrawDisk (x,0,r,FillColor= CYAN,EdgeWidth =0) 
Draw the Third Disk  
x = x + 1.5*r  
r = r/2 
DrawDisk (x,0,r,FillColor= MAGENTA,EdgeWidth =0
) 
Overall  
x = -4; r = 4  
DrawDisk (x,"
"0,r,FillColor= MAGENTA,EdgeWidth =0) 
 
x = x + 1.5*r; r = r/2  
DrawDisk (x,0,r,FillColor= CYAN,EdgeWidth =0) 
 
x = x + 1.5*r; r = r/2  
DrawDisk (x,0,r,FillColor= MAGENTA,EdgeWidth =0) 
 
x = x + 1.5*r; r = r/2  
DrawDisk (x,0,r,FillColor= CYAN,EdgeWidth =0) 
Notice the repetition of the x and r updates. Simpler than figuring  
the centers and radii “by hand”. Also gets us ready for loops.  Let’s Draw a Star

When a module is imported, it gives access to  
both its functions and its global variables.  
Take a look at the Demos ShowRect.py,  ShowDisk.py , and ShowStar.py  rgb Lists  
Things like [0.74,1.00,0.34]  are called rgb 
lists. 
 
Rules: Square brackets, 3 numbers separated by  
commas, each number between 0"
" and 1.  
 
First number  = red value  
Second number = green value  
Third number = blue value  
 
The bigger numbers mean more of that color.  
 Using rgb Lists  
Instead of using the predefined colors you can  
make up and use your own fill color, e.g.  
  
  c = [0.74,1.00,0.34]  
  DrawDisk (0,0,1,FillColor=c)  
 
 
Google “ rgb values” to look at huge tables of  
colors and rgb values.

Shows two things.  
 
1.You can write a module that uses other  
modules that YOU have written.  
 
2. You can have a module that has both function  
definitions and a script that can be executed.

Application

Those are “dou"
"ble underscores” in the if statement.  Summary  
1.Procedures “look like” functions without  
   the “return.” They “do stuff” but do not  
   return values  
 
2. Graphics procedures were used to  
    illustrate the idea.  
 
3. Color can be encoded with three numbers  
    that indicate the amount of red, green,  
    and blue.  
 
4. A single module can house data, functions,  
and a script at the same time

cannot change element values, immutable
represented with parentheses

t = (2,""mit"",3)
t[0] evaluates to 2
(2,""mit"",3) + (5,6) evaluates to (2,""mit"",3,5,6)
t[1:2] slice tuple, evaluates to (""mit"",)
t[1:3] slice tuple, evaluates to (""mit"",3)
len(t) evaluates to 3
t[1] = 4 gives error, can’t modify object
6.0001 LECTURE 5 4TUPLES

ordered sequence of information, accessible by index
a list is denoted by square brackets , []
a list contains elements
•usually homogeneous ( ie, all integers)
•can contain mixed types (not common )
list elements can be changed so a list is mutable

del(L[1]) mutates L = [1,3,7,0]
L.pop() returns 0 and mutates L = [1,3,7]
6.0001 LECTURE 5 13CONVERT LISTS TO STRINGS 
AND BACK
convert string to list with list(s), returns a list with every 
character from san element in L 
can use s.split(), to split a string on a character parameter, 
splits on spaces if called without a parameter
use ''.join(L) to turn a lis"
"t of characters into a string , can 
give a character in quotes to add char between every element
6.0001 LECTURE 5 14s = ""I<3 cs"" sis a string

and
TRICKY!
6.0001 LECTURE 5 16LISTS IN MEMORY
lists are mutable
behave differently than immutable types
is an object in memory
variable name points to object
any variable pointing to that object is affected
key phrase to keep in mind when working with lists is 
side effects
6.0001 LECTURE 5 17AN ANALOGY
att"
"ributes of a person
◦singer, rich
he is known by many names
all nicknames point to the same person
•add new attribute to one nickname … 
•… all his nicknames refer to old attributes AND all new ones
6.0001 LECTURE 5 18Justin Bieber singer rich troublemaker
The Bieb singer rich troublemaker
JBeebs singer rich troublemakerALIASES
hot is an alias for warm –changing one changes the 
other!
append() has a side effect
6.0001 LECTURE 5 19
CLONING A LIST
create a new list and copy every element using 
chill = "
"cool[:]
6.0001 LECTURE 5 20
SORTING LISTS
calling sort() mutates the list, returns nothing
calling sorted() 
does not mutate 
list, must assign 
result to a variable
6.0001 LECTURE 5 21
LISTS OF LISTS OF LISTS OF….
can have nested lists
side effects still 
possible after mutation
6.0001 LECTURE 5 22
MUTATION AND ITERATION
Try this in Python Tutor!
avoid mutating a list as you are iterating over it

"e_dups (L1, L2)
L1 is [2,3,4] not [3,4] Why? 
•Python uses an internal counter to keep track of index it is in the loop
•mutating changes the list length but Python doesn’t update the counter
•loop never sees element 2

Python code  
 
The name of the  
module is the name  
of the file. This is  
the module M1.py 
 
We draw a module  
as a folder with a  
black outline.    
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 A module may contain  
a single script.  
 
A script will be shown  
as a rectangle with  "
"
a red border.

module M2.py  can be imported 
by a module M1.py Does this Always Work?  
Yes, if  M2.py is a module that is part  
of the CS 1110 Python installation, e.g.,  
 
math  numpy urllib2  string  
scipy PIL   random timeit . 
    
import M2  
    :    M1.py     Does this Always Work?  
No UNLESS   M1.py  and M2.py are each

"y does not

Distinguish between calling a function  
 
                 y = sqrt(3) 
 
and defining a function  
 
   def sqrt(x): 
     L = x 
     L = (L + x/L)/2  
    L = (L + x/L)/2  
    return L   
A function isn’t executed when it is defined.  
Think of defining a function as setting up a formula that is to be used later.    We now focus our attention  
on the mechanics behind  
function calls.  Somewhat  Like Plugging into a 
Formula  
  
 
  For the simple kind "
"of fruitful functions  
that we have been considering, there is a  
substitution process.  
 
Exactly how does it work?  We Use This Example…

AN ANALOGY WITH SOUP
You are making soup but bugs keep falling in from the 
ceiling. What do you do?
check soup for bugs
•testing
keep lid closed
•defensive 
programming
clean kitchen
•eliminate source 
of bugs
Analogy thanks to Prof Srini Devadas
6.0001 LECTURE 7 2DEFENSIVE PROGRAMMING
•Write specifications for functions
•Modularize programs
•Check co"
"nditions on inputs/outputs (assertions)
TESTING/VALIDATION
•Compare input/output 
pairs to specification
•“It’s not working!”
•“How can I break my 
program?”DEBUGGING
•Study events leading up 
to an error
•“Why is it not working?”
•“How can I fix my 
program?”
6.0001 LECTURE 7 3SET YOURSELF UP FOR EASY 
TESTING AND DEBUGGING
from the start , design code to ease this part
break program up into modules that can be tested 
and debugged individually
document constraints on modules
•what do you expect the inp"
"ut to be?
•what do you expect the output to be?
document assumptions behind code design
6.0001 LECTURE 7 4WHEN ARE YOU READY TO 
TEST?
ensure code runs
•remove syntax errors
•remove static semantic errors
•Python interpreter can usually find these for you
have a set of expected results
•an input set
•for each input, the expected output
6.0001 LECTURE 7 5CLASSES OF TESTS
Unit testing
•validate each piece of program
•testing each function separately
Regression testing
•add test for bugs as you find them
"
"•catch reintroduced errors that were previously fixed
Integration testing
•does overall program work?
•tend to rush to do this
6.0001 LECTURE 7 6TESTING APPROACHES

6.0001 LECTURE 7 18OTHER TYPES OF EXCEPTIONS
already seen common error types:
•SyntaxError : Python can’t parse program
•NameError : local or global name not found
•AttributeError : attribute reference fails
•TypeError : operand doesn’t have correct type
•ValueError : operand type okay, but value is illegal
•IOError : IO system reports malfunction (e.g. file not 
found "
")
6.0001 LECTURE 7 19DEALING WITH EXCEPTIONS
Python code can provide handlers for exceptions
try:
a = int(input(""Tell me one number:""))
b = int(input(""Tell me another number:""))
print(a/b)
except:
print(""Bug in user input ."")
exceptions raised by any statement in body of try are 
handled by the except statement and execution continues 
with the body of the except statement
6.0001 LECTURE 7 20HANDLING SPECIFIC 
EXCEPTIONS
have separate except clauses to deal with a particular 
type of exception
try:
a = i"
"nt(input(""Tell me one number: ""))
b = int(input(""Tell me another number: ""))
print(""a/b = "", a/b)
print(""a+b= "", a+b)
except ValueError :
print(""Could not convert to a number ."")
except ZeroDivisionError :
print(""Can't divide by zero"")
except:
print(""Something went very wrong ."")
6.0001 LECTURE 7 21OTHER EXCEPTIONS
else:
•body of this is executed when execution of associated 
try body completes with no exceptions
finally :
•body of this is always executed after try ,  else and 
except clauses, even if the"
"y raised another error or 
executed a break , continue or return
•useful for clean -up code that should be run no matter 
what else happened (e.g. close a file)
6.0001 LECTURE 7 22WHAT TO DO WITH 
EXCEPTIONS?
what to do when encounter an error?
fail silently : 
•substitute default values or just continue
•bad idea! user gets no warning
return an “error” value
•what value to choose?
•complicates code having to check for a special value
stop execution, signal error condition
•in Python: raise an exception"
"
raise Exception(""descriptive string"")
6.0001 LECTURE 7 23EXCEPTIONS AS CONTROL 
FLOW
don’t return special values when an error occurred 
and then check whether ‘error value’ was returned
instead, raise an exception when unable to produce a 
result consistent with function’s specification
raise <exceptionName >(<arguments>)
raise ValueError (""something is wrong"")
6.0001 LECTURE 7 24EXAMPLE: RAISING AN 
EXCEPTION

otherwise runs ok
32 6.0001 LECTURE 7ASSERTIONS AS DEFENSIVE 
PROGRAMMING
assertions don’t allow a programmer to control 
response to unexpected conditions
ensure that execution halts whenever an expected 
condition is not met
typically used to check inputs to functions, but "
"can be 
used anywhere
can be used to check outputs of a function to avoid 
propagating bad values
can make it easier to locate a source of a bug
33 6.0001 LECTURE 7WHERE TO USE ASSERTIONS?
goal is to spot bugs as soon as introduced and make 
clear where they happened
use as a supplement to testing
raise exceptions if users supplies bad data input
use assertions to
•check types of arguments or values
•check that invariants on data structures are met
•check constraints on return values
•check for violat"
"ions of constraints on procedure (e.g. no 
duplicates in a list)

6.0001 LECTURE 8 1OBJECTS
Python supports many different kinds of data
1234 3.14159 ""Hello"" [1, 5, 7, 11, 13]
{""CA"": ""California"", ""MA"": ""Massachusetts""}
each is an object , and every object has:
•a type
•an internal data representation (primitive or composite)
•a set of procedures for interaction with the object
an object is an instance of a type
•1234 is an instance of an int
•""hello"" is an instance of a st"
"ring
6.0001 LECTURE 8 2OBJECT ORIENTED 
PROGRAMMING (OOP)
EVERYTHING IN PYTHON IS AN OBJECT (and has a type)
can create new objects of some type
can manipulate objects
can destroy objects
•explicitly using del or just “forget” about them
•python system will reclaim destroyed or inaccessible 
objects –called “garbage collection ”
6.0001 LECTURE 8 3WHAT ARE OBJECTS?
objects are a data abstraction
that captures…
(1) an internal representation 
•through data attributes
(2) an interface for 
interacting wit"
"h object 
•through methods 
(aka procedures/functions)
•defines behaviors but 
hides implementation
6.0001 LECTURE 8 4how are lists represented internally ? linked list of cells
L =
how to manipulate lists?
•L[i], L[i:j], +
•len(), min(), max(), del(L[i])
•L.append(),L.extend(),L.count(),L.index(), 
L.insert(),L.pop(),L.remove(),L.reverse (), L.sort()
internal representation should be private
correct behavior may be compromised if you manipulate 
internal representation directlyEXAMPLE: 
[1,2,3,4] has t"
"ype list
6.0001 LECTURE 8 51        -> 2       -> 3       -> 4       ->ADVANTAGES OF OOP
bundle data into packages together with procedures 
that work on them through well -defined interfaces
divide -and-conquer development
•implement and test behavior of each class separately
•increased modularity reduces complexity
classes make it easy to reuse code
•many Python modules define new classes
•each class has a separate environment (no collision on 
function names)
•inheritance allows subclasses to redefine"
" or extend a 
selected subset of a superclass’ behavior
6.0001 LECTURE 8 6make a distinction between creating a class and 
using an instance of the class
creating the class involves
•defining the class name
•defining class attributes
•for example, someone wrote code to implement a list class
using the class involves
•creating new instances of objects
•doing operations on the instances
•for example, L=[1,2] and len(L)
6.0001 LECTURE 8 7Implementing the class Using the class
CREATING AND USING YOUR 
OWN TY"
"PES WITH CLASSESDEFINE YOUR OWN TYPES
use the class keyword to define a new type
class Coordinate(object):
#define attributes here
similar to def, indent code to indicate which statements are 
part of the class definition
the word object means that Coordinate is a Python 
object and inherits all its attributes (inheritance next lecture) 
•Coordinate is a subclass of object
•object is a superclass of Coordinate
6.0001 LECTURE 8 8Implementing the class Using the classWHAT ARE ATTRIBUTES?
data and procedur"
"es that “ belong ” to the class
data attributes
•think of data as other objects that make up the class
•for example, a coordinate is made up of two numbers
methods (procedural attributes)
•think of methods as functions that only work with this class
•how to interact with the object
•for example you can define a distance between two 
coordinate objects but there is no meaning to a distance 
between two list objects
6.0001 LECTURE 8 9DEFINING HOW TO CREATE AN 
INSTANCE OF A CLASS
first have to define how t"
"o create an instance of 
object 
use a special method called __init__ to 
initialize some data attributes
class Coordinate(object):
def __init__(self, x, y):
self.x= x
self.y= y
6.0001 LECTURE 8 10Implementing the class Using the classACTUALLY CREATING AN 
INSTANCE OF A CLASS
c = Coordinate(3,4)
origin = Coordinate(0,0)
print(c.x)
print(origin.x)
data attributes of an instance are called instance 
variables
don’t provide argument for self , Python does this 
automatically
6.0001 LECTURE 8 11Implementing "
"the class Using the classWHAT IS A METHOD?
procedural attribute, like a function that works only 
with this class
Python always passes the object as the first argument
•convention is to use self as the name of the first 
argument of all methods
the “ .”operator is used to access any attribute
•a data attribute of an object
•a method of an object
6.0001 LECTURE 8 12DEFINE A METHOD FOR THE 
Coordinate CLASS
class Coordinate(object):
def __init__(self, x, y):
self.x= x
self.y= y
def distance(self , other):
"
"x_diff_sq = ( self.x-other.x)**2
y_diff_sq = (self.y-other.y)**2
return (x_diff_sq +y_diff_sq)**0.5
other than self and dot notation, methods behave just 
like functions (take params, do operations, return)
6.0001 LECTURE 8 13Implementing the class Using the classHOW TO USE A METHOD
def distance(self, other):
# code here
Using the class:
conventional way
c = Coordinate(3,4)
zero = Coordinate(0,0)print(c.distance(zero))
6.0001 LECTURE 8 14equivalent to 
c = Coordinate(3,4)zero = Coordinate(0,0 )
print(Coo"

AN OBJECT
>>> c = Coordinate(3,4) 
>>> print(c)
<__main__.Coordinate object at 0x7fa918510488>
uninformative print representation by default
define a __str__method for a class
Python calls the __str__ method when used with 
print on your class object
you choose what it does! Say that when we print a 
Coordinate object, want to show

def __str__(self):
return ""<""+str( self.x)+"",""+str( self.y)+"">""
6.0001 LECTURE 8 16Implementing the class Using the classWRAPPING YOUR HEAD 
AROUND TYPES AND CLASSES
can ask for the type of an object instance
>>> c = Coordinate(3,4)
>>> print(c)
<3,4>
>>> print(type(c))
<class __ main__.Coordinate>
this makes sense since
>>> "
"print(Coordinate)
<class __ main__.Coordinate>
>>> print(type(Coordinate))
<type 'type'>
use isinstance() to check if an object is a Coordinate
>>> print(isinstance (c, Coordinate ))
True
6.0001 LECTURE 8 17Implementing the class Using the classSPECIAL OPERATORS
+, -, ==, <, >, len(), print, and many others
https ://docs.python.org/3/reference/datamodel.html#basic -customization
like print , can override these to work with your class
define them with double underscores before/after
__add__(self, other) "
"self + other
__sub__(self, other) self -other
__eq__(self, other) self == other
__lt__(self, other) self < other
__len__(self) len(self)
__str__(self) print self
... and others
6.0001 LECTURE 8 18EXAMPLE: FRACTIONS
create a new type to represent a number as a fraction
internal representation is two integers
•numerator
•denominator
interface a.k.a. methods a.k.a how to interact with 
Fraction objects
•add, subtract
•print representation, convert to a float
•invert the fraction
the code for this is "
"in the handout, check it out!
6.0001 LECTURE 8 19THE POWER OF OOP
bundle together objects that share 
•common attributes and 
•procedures that operate on those attributes
use abstraction to make a distinction between how to 
implement an object vs how to use the object
build layers of object abstractions that inherit 
behaviors from other classes of objects
create our own classes of objects on top of Python’s 
basic classes

6.0001 LECTURE 9 9AN INSTANCE and 
DOT NOTATION (RECAP)
instantiation creates an instance of an object
a = Animal(3)
dot notation used to access attributes (data and 
methods) though it is better to use getters and setters 
to access data attributes
a.age
a.get_age ()

author of class definition may change data attribute 
variable names

if you are accessing data attributes outside the class and 
class definition changes , may get errors
outside of class, use getters and setters instead 
use a.get_age ()NOT a.age
•good style
•easy to maintain code
•prevents bugs

 Estimating probabilities  
 Estimating averages  
 More occasions to practice iteration  
 
 
 The random  Module  
Contains functions that can be used   
in the design of random simulations.  
 
We will practice with these:  
 
  random.randint (a,b) 
  random.uniform (a,b) 
  random.normalvariate (mu,sigma ) 
 
 
  And as a fringe benefit, more practice with for -loops   Generating Random Integers  
 That is, we randomly select an element from the set"
" {a,a+1,…,b} and assign it to n   If a and b are initialized integers with a < b 
then  
               i = random.randint (a,b) 
 
assigns to  i a “random” integer that satisfies  
 
                             a <= i <= b 
 What Does “Random” Mean?  
import random  
for k in range(1000000):  
   i = random.randint (1,6) 
   print i 
 
The output would “look like” you rolled a dice  
one million times and recorded the outcomes.  
 
No discernible pattern.

Idea:  
 
 Set up a game whose outcome tells us  
 something about pi.  
 
 This problem solving strategy is called  
 Monte Carlo . It is widely used in certain 
areas of science and engineering.  
 
 
 The Game  
Throw darts at the  
2x2 cyan square that  
is centered at (0,0).  
 
If the dart lands in  
the radius -1 disk, then  
count that as a ”hit”.  3 Facts About the Game  
1. Area of square = 4  
 
2. Area of disk  is  pi 
since the radius is 1.  
 
3. Ratio of hits to throws 
shoul"
"d approximate 
pi/4  and so  
 
 
    4*hits/throws  “=“  pi

1000 throws  
 
776 hits  
 
Pi = 4*776/1000

The boundary of the disk is given by  
                   
                              x**2 + y**2 = 1  
 
If (x,y) is the coordinate of the dart throw,  
then it is inside the disk if  
                              x**2+y**2 <= 1  
 
is True. Solution  
from random import uniform as randu

Hits = 0  
for throws in range(N):  
    "
"x = randu(-1,1) 
    y = randu(-1,1)

In science, whenever you make a discovery 
through experimentation, you must provide 
enough details for others to repeat the 
experiment.  
 
We have “discovered” pi through random 
simulation. How can others repeat our 
computation?  random.seed

"actually pseudo -random numbers . 
 
They pass rigorous statistical tests so that  
we can use them as if they are truly random.  
 
But  they are generated by a program and are  
anything but random.  
 
The  seed   function can be used to reset the  
algorithmic process that generates the pseudo  
random numbers.  Repeatable Solution

"Loops 
Fall 2019 Loops 
●Loops are a way to repeat segments of code a certain number of times or 
until a certain condition is met 
●Without a loop, there is no way a segment of code will be run more than once 
○(* unless you get into recursion, which often confuses even seasoned 
programmers) 
●Python (and most other languages) has two forms of loops: for loops and 
while loops 
●The loop-body (what you want the loop to do) follows same convention as 
conditions 
○Whatever is inside the loop must be indent"
"ed 
○Whatever is outside the loop is unindented 
2For Loops 
●Used to complete an action a certain number of times 
○Can use a variable for the number of times it will run 
○Has to be a predetermined number of times (cannot dynamically 
determine it) 
●Also used to count items 
○More uses for this become apparent once sequences are introduced 
●Referred to commonly as “count-controlled loops” 
3For Loops 
●Created by keyword “for” 
●Uses Python built-in function “range” 
○Counts start at 0, not 1 (unless st"
"ated otherwise) 
○Ranges work on “less than” not “less than or equal 
to”
○Each portion of the loop adds 1 (unless stated 
otherwise) 
●i in this example is your “iterator” or the variable assigned 
to carry your counting value 
4
Range Function (Incrementing) 
●range() can have 1, 2, or 3 arguments 
5Number of Arguments Arguments Definition 
1 -- ex. range(10) Count starts at 0, goes to less than the 
amount specified in first argument, adds 
one on each pass through the loop 
2 -- ex. range(1, 10) Count s"
"tarts at first argument (1 in the 
example), goes to less than the amount 
specified in second argument, adds one on 
each pass through the loop 
3 -- ex. range(0, 10, 2) Count starts at first argument (0 in the 
example), goes to less than the amount 
specified in second argument, adds the 
amount in the third argument (2 in the 
example) on each pass through Range Examples (Incrementing) 
6
Range Function (Decrementing) 
●With decrementing, you can only use the 3 argument range version 
●You specify the s"
"tarting point (first argument), the ending point (second 
argument), and the amount you’re subtracting by (third argument) 
●Goes to greater than the ending point, not greater than or equal to 
7
For Loop Notes: 
●Don’t have  to print out or even use the count in a for-loop 
○Can be used purely to repeat an action a certain amount of times 
●Can use the count in calculations, not just print it 
8
For Loop Notes: 
●You can have for loops that do nothing 
○Take a look at your range function and see if it’s at"
"tainable 
●The range function only accepts whole numbers (no decimals) 
9
While Loops 
●Used to repeat a segment of code until a certain condition is met 
○Conditions are in the same vein as if-statements 
●Can dynamically determine when to end the loop (due to the conditions) 
●Can emulate for-loops, but they aren’t as efficient 
●Referred to as “condition-controlled loops” 
10While Loops 
●Created by keyword “while” 
●Uses conditions, much like if-statements 
do
●Have to change  the variable being 
compar"
"ed or you’ll create an infinite loop 
(a loop that does not end) 
●Code after the while-loop does not 
execute until the conditions of the while 
loop have been met 
11
While Loops 
●Like if-statements, you can have compound conditions 
●Pay attention to what and/or combination you’re doing 
○This could affect whether your loop is doing what it should be 
○It could unintentionally create an infinite loop 
12
Simulated For Loop 
13
Loop Notes: 
●If in an infinite loop, you can “ctrl-C” to break out of the lo"
"op 
●If you see yourself in an infinite loop, check: 
○Am I changing the thing I’m comparing? 
○Am I checking the right thing? 
○Is it a compound condition? Am I using and/or correctly? 
○Is my logic correct?

"Nesting 
Fall 2019 Nesting 
●The idea of placing one structure inside of another 
○Conditions inside of conditions 
○Loops inside of loops 
○Conditions inside of loops 
○Etc.
●Can triple-nest, quadruple-nest, quintuple-nest, etc… 
○As long as the syntax is correct, there’s no real limits (it just may take a 
long time to run) 
2Nesting Syntax 
●Since structures like conditions and loops are delimited by indentation, you 
simply need to add more indentation to nest one inside of another 
●Anything outside of"
" each structure would be unindented accordingly 
3Nesting Uses 
●Allows for more specialized loops/conditions 
●Typically it’s meant to limit functionality of the inner structures 
○They should only execute under specialized conditions 
●Can make code more efficient 
○Especially when relating to conditions 
4Syntax Notes: 
●Make sure your indentation lines up 
correctly 
●You can mix and match a lot, so be 
careful 
○Still need to adhere to syntax 
rules 
5Nesting Tip: 
●It can sometimes be hard to follow w"
"hat is nested inside of what due to how 
Python is delimited (indentation) 
●Commenting the end of a structure at the original indentation level can 
sometimes help traverse nesting

"Objects 
Fall 2019 Programming Practices 
●Procedural Programming 
○Focuses on executing a specific task 
○All about what procedures (functions) accomplish a task 
●Object-Oriented Programming 
○Focuses on creating objects through classes 
■Contains data and procedures (functions) 
2Object 
●What is an object? 
○A value in memory referenced by an identifier 
○Procedural 
■Functions 
■Variables (an instance of a string, integer, etc) 
■etc
○Object-oriented 
■An instance of a class 
■Contains the data and fun"
"ctions 
3Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) 
●Based around the idea of essentially creating your own data type 
○Means we won’t be limited by strings, ints, floats, booleans 
●Data 
○Also known as “class attributes” 
○Data (variables) that are relevant to the class 
●Functions 
○OOP does contain procedures, or functions 
○The procedures must pertain to the object you’re creating, though 
○Something you want to do with the data 
4Object Example 
●Rectangle 
○Data 
■Height 
■Width 
■Color 
■etc
○Functions 
■Ca"
"lculate perimeter 
■Calculate area 
■etc
5Object Example 
●Class (like a class you take) 
○Data 
■Course code 
■Course name 
■Hours 
■etc
○Functions 
■Add class 
■Drop class 
■View classes 
■etc
6OOP Uses 
●Encapsulation 
○Refers to the practice of placing similar data and functions within the 
same code 
○Makes testing easier 
■Ex. If there’s an error in calculating the average, you don’t have to 
look at a code base dealing with rectangles 
○Maintenance is improved 
■Updated parts of the code affects less"
" around it 
■Taking down one part doesn’t (always) affect the entire code base 
7OOP Uses 
●Object Reusability 
○Makes reusing code infinitely easier 
○If a separate program deals a lot with rectangles and you already have a 
class built, just include that file instead of making new code 
●Productivity 
○Organization is much easier 
○Each file can contain a solitary class 
■Makes locating code and finding what you need easier

Python Review. Modified slides from Marty Stepp  and Moshe Goldstein  2 code or source code : The sequence of instructions in a program.  
 
syntax : The set of legal structures and commands that can be 
used in a particular programming language.  
 
output : The messages printed to the user by a program.  
 
console : The text box onto which output is printed.  
Some source code editors pop up the console as an external window,

Programming basics  
3 Compiling and interpreting  
Many languages require you to compile (translate) your program 
into a form that the machine understands.  
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
Python is instead directly interpreted into machine instructions.   compile  execute

The Python Interpreter  
•Python is an interpreted 
language  
•The interpreter provides 
an interactive environ"
"ment 
to play with the language  
•Results of expressions are 
printed on the screen  >>> 3 + 7  
10 
>>> 3 < 15  
True 
>>> 'print me'  
'print me'  
>>> print 'print me'  
print me  
>>>  5 Expressions  
expression : A data value or set of operations to compute a value.  
 Examples:  1 + 4 * 3  
    42 
 
Arithmetic operators we will use:  
+ - * /  addition, subtraction/negation, multiplication, division  
%    modulus, a.k.a. remainder  
**   exponentiation  
 
precedence : Order in which operatio"
"ns are computed.  
* / % **  have a higher precedence than + - 
 
1 + 3 * 4  is 13 
 
Parentheses can be used to force a certain order of evaluation.  
 
(1 + 3) * 4  is 16 6 Integer division  
When we divide integers with / , the quotient is also an integer.

                                  3 7 Real numbers  
Python can also manipulate real numbers.  
Examples: 6.022  -15.9997  42.0 2.143e17  
 
The operators + - * / % **  ( ) all work for real numbers.  
The / "
"produces an exact answer: 15.0 / 2.0  is 7.5 
The same rules of precedence also apply to real numbers:  
Evaluate  ( )  before  * / %  before  + - 
 
When integers and reals are mixed, the result is a real number.  
Example:  1 / 2.0   is  0.5 
 
The conversion occurs on a per -operator basis.  
7 / 3 * 1.2 + 3 / 2  
  2   * 1.2 + 3 / 2 
    2.4     + 3 / 2 
    2.4     +   1 
         3.4 8 Math commands  
Python has useful commands  (or called functions)  for performing 
calculations.  
 
 
 
 
"
" 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
 
To use many of these commands, you must write the following at 
the top of your Python program:

variable : A named piece of memory that can store a value.  
Usage:  
Compute an expression's result,  
store that result into a variable,  
and "
"use that variable later in the program.  
 
assignment statement : Stores a value into a variable.  
Syntax:  
 
  name = value 
 
Examples:  x = 5 
    gpa = 3.14  
 
     x   5         gpa    3.14  
 
A variable that has been given a value can be used in expressions.  
  x + 4  is 9 
 
Exercise: Evaluate the quadratic equation for a given a, b, and c. 
 
  Example  
>>> x = 7  
>>> x  
7 
>>> x+7  
14 
>>> x = 'hello'  
>>> x  
'hello'  
>>>  
 12 print  : Produces text output on the console.  
 
S"
"yntax:  
 print "" Message "" 
 print Expression  
Prints the given text message or expression value on the console, and 
moves the cursor down to the next line.  
 
 print Item1, Item2, ..., ItemN 
Prints several messages and/or expressions on the same line.  
 
Examples:  
 print ""Hello, world!""  
 age = 45  
 print ""You have"", 65 - age, ""years until retirement""  
 
Output:  
 
 Hello, world!  
 You have 20 years until retirement  print  Example: print Statement  
>>> print 'hello'  
hello 
>>> print 'he"
"llo', 'there'  
hello there  
 •Elements separated by 
commas print with a space 
between them  
•A comma at the end of the 
statement (print ‘hello’,) 
will not print a newline 
character  14 input  : Reads a number from user input.  
You can assign (store) the result of input  into a variable.  
Example:  
 age = input(""How old are you? "")  
 print ""Your age is"", age  
 print ""You have"", 65 - age, ""years until retirement""  
 
 Output:  
 
 How old are you? 53 
 Your age is 53  
 You have 12 years until"
" retirement  
 
 
 
Exercise: Write a Python program that prompts the user for 
his/her amount of money, then reports how many Nintendo Wiis 
the person can afford, and how much more money he/she will 
need to afford an additional Wii.  input Input: Example  
print ""What's your name?""  
name = raw_input(""> "")  
 
print ""What year were you born?""  
birthyear = int(raw_input(""> ""))  
 
print ""Hi “, name, “!”, “You are “, 2016 – birthyear  
% python input.py

Repetition (loops)  
and Selection (if/else)  17 The for loop 
for loop: Repeats a set of statements over a group of values.  
 
Syntax:  
 
 for variableName  in groupOfValues : 
     statements  
 
We indent the statements to be repeated with tabs or spaces.  
variableName  gives a name to each value, so you can refer to it in the statements . 
groupOfValues  can be a range of integers, specified with the range  function.  
 
Example:  
 
 for x in ran"
"ge(1, 6):  
     print x, ""squared is"", x * x  
 
 Output:  
 1 squared is 1  
 2 squared is 4  
 3 squared is 9  
 4 squared is 16  
 5 squared is 25  18 range 
The range  function specifies a range of integers:  
range( start, stop)  - the integers between start  (inclusive)  
      and stop (exclusive)  
 
It can also accept a third value specifying the change between values.  
range( start, stop, step) - the integers between start  (inclusive)  
      and stop (exclusive) by step 
 
Example:  
 for"
" x in range(5, 0, -1): 
     print x 
 print ""Blastoff!""  
 
 Output:  
 5 
 4 
 3  
 2 
 1 
 Blastoff!  
 
Exercise: How would we print the ""99 Bottles of Beer"" song?  19 Cumulative loops  
Some loops incrementally compute a value that is initialized outside 
the loop.  This is sometimes called a cumulative sum . 
 
 sum = 0 
 for i in range(1, 11):  
     sum = sum + (i * i)  
 print ""sum of first 10 squares is"", sum  
 
 Output: 
 sum of first 10 squares is 385  
 
 
 
Exercise: Write a Python program"
" that computes the factorial of an 
integer.  20 if 
if statement : Executes a group of statements only if a certain 
condition is true.  Otherwise, the statements are skipped.  
 
Syntax:  
 if condition : 
     statements  
 
Example:  
 gpa = 3.4  
 if gpa > 2.0:  
     print ""Your application is accepted.""  
21 
if/else 
if/else  statement : Executes one block of statements if a certain 
condition is True, and a second block of statements if it is False.  
 
Syntax:  
 if condition : 
     statemen"
"ts  
 else: 
     statements  
 
Example:  
 gpa = 1.4  
 if gpa > 2.0:  
     print ""Welcome to Mars University!""  
 else: 
     print ""Your application is denied.""  
 
Multiple conditions can be chained with elif (""else if""):  
 if condition : 
     statements  
 elif condition : 
     statements  
 else: 
     statements  
 
Example of If Statements  
import math  
x = 30  
if x <= 15 :  
    y = x + 15  
elif x <= 30  :  
    y = x + 30  
else : 
    y = x  
print ‘y = ‘,  
print math.sin(y)  
In file"
" ifstatement.py  >>> import ifstatement  
y =  0.999911860107  
>>>  
In interpreter  23 while  
while  loop: Executes a group of statements as long as a condition is True.  
good for indefinite loops (repeat an unknown number of times)  
 
Syntax:  
 while condition : 
     statements  
 
Example:  
 number = 1  
 while number < 200:  
     print number,  
     number = number * 2  
 
Output:  
 1 2 4 8 16 32 64 128

 Lists: Modifying Content  
x[i] = a    reassigns 
the ith element to the 
value a  
Since x and y point to 
the sa"
"me list object, 
both are changed  
The method append  
also modifies the list  >>> x = [1,2,3]  
>>> y = x  
>>> x[1] = 15  
>>> x  
[1, 15, 3]  
>>> y  
[1, 15, 3]  
>>> x.append(12)  
>>> y

Tuples are immutable  
versions of lists  
One strange point is 
the format to make a 
tuple with one

>>> setB=set([""c"",""d"",""e"",""f""])  
>>> ""a"" in setA  
True 
>>> ""a"" in setB  
False Sets 
>>> setA - setB

>>> d['two'] = 99  
>>> d  
{1: 'hello', 'two': 99, 'blah': [1, 2, 3]}  
>>> d[7] = 'new entry'  
>>> d  
{1: 'hello', 7: 'new entry', 'two': 99, 'blah': [1, 2, 3]}  Entries can be changed by assigning to 
that entry  
 
•Assigning to a key that does not exist 
adds an entry  Dictionaries: Deleting Elements  
The del method deletes an element from a 
dictionary  
>>> d

Text and File Processing  68 string : A sequence of text characters in a program.  
Strings start and end with quotation mark "" or apostrophe ' characters.  
Examples:  
 
""hello"" 
""This is a string""  
""This, too, is a string.   It can be very long!""  
 
A string may not span"
" across multiple lines or contain a "" character.  
""This is not  
a legal String.""  
 ""This is not a ""legal"" String either.""  
 
A string can represent characters by preceding them with a backslash.  
\t tab character  
\n new line character  
\"" quotation mark character  
\\ backslash character  
 
Example:  ""Hello\tthere\nHow are you?""  Strings  69 Indexes  
Characters in a string are numbered with indexes  starting at 0:  
Example:  
 name = ""P. Diddy""  
 
  
 
 
Accessing an individual characte"
"r of a string:

 name = ""Martin Douglas Stepp""  
 length = len(name)  
 big_name = str.upper(name)  
 print big_name, ""h"
"as"", length, ""characters""  
 
 Output:  
 MARTIN DOUGLAS STEPP has 20 characters  71 raw_input  : Reads a string of text from user input.  
Example:  
 name = raw_input(""Howdy, pardner. What's yer name? "")  
 print name, ""... what a silly name!""  
 
 Output:  
 
 Howdy, pardner. What's yer name? Paris Hilton  
 Paris Hilton ... what a silly name!  raw_input  72 Text processing  
text processing : Examining, editing, formatting text.  
often uses loops that examine the characters of a string one by one  "
"
 
A for loop can examine each character in a string in sequence.  
 
Example:  
  
 for c in ""booyah"":  
     print c 
 
 Output:  
 b 
 o 
 o 
 y 
 a 
 h 73 Strings and numbers  
ord(text)  - converts a string into a number.  
Example: ord(""a"")  is 97,  ord(""b"")  is 98, ... 
 
Characters map to numbers using standardized mappings such as 
ASCII  and Unicode . 
 
chr(number ) - converts a number into a string.  
Example: chr(99)  is ""c"" 
 
 
Exercise:  Write a program that performs a rotation cyphe"
"r.  
e.g. ""Attack""  when rotated by 1 becomes ""buubdl""  74 File processing  
Many programs handle data, which often comes from files.  
 
Reading the entire contents of a file:  
 
variableName  = open("" filename "").read()  
 
 
Example:  
file_text = open(""bankaccount.txt"").read()  75 Line-by-line processing  
Reading a file line -by-line: 
 
for line in open("" filename "").readlines():  
    statements  
 
Example:  
count = 0  
for line in open(""bankaccount.txt"").readlines():  
    count = count + 1  "
"
print ""The file contains"", count, ""lines.""  
 
 
 
Exercise: Write a program to process a file of DNA text, such as:  
 ATGCAATTGCTCGATTAG  
Count the percent of C+G present in the DNA.   
76 
Objects and Classes  Defining a Class  
Python program may own many objects  
An object is an item with fields supported by a set of method functions.  
An object can have several fields (or called attribute variables) describing 
such an object  
These fields can be accessed or modified by object methods  
A "
"class defines what objects look like and what functions can operate 
on these object.  
 
Declaring a class:  
 
 class name: 
     statements  
Example:  
 
 class UCSBstudent:  
    age = 21  
    schoolname=‘UCSB’  
      
 Fields  
 name = value  
 
Example:  
 
 class Point:  
     x = 0 
     y = 0 
 
 # main 
 p1 = Point()  
 p1.x = 2  
 p1.y = -5 
 
can be declared directly inside class (as shown here)  
or in constructors (more common)  
 
Python does not really have encapsulation or private f"
"ields  
relies on caller to ""be nice"" and not mess with objects' contents  point.py

        return sqrt(dx * dx + dy * dy) Calling Methods  
A client can call the methods of an object in two ways:  
(the value of self can be an implicit or explicit parameter)  
 
 1) object.method(parameters ) 
  or 
 2) Class.method(object, parameters ) 
 
Example:  
p = Point(3, -4) 
p.m"
"ove(1, 5) 
Point.move (p, 1, 5) Constructors  
 def __init__ (self , parameter , ..., parameter ): 
     statements  
 
a constructor is a special method with the name __init__  
 
Example:  
 
 class Point:  
     def __init__(self, x, y):  
         self.x = x  
         self.y = y  
     ... 
 
How would we make it possible to construct a  
Point()  with no parameters to get (0, 0)?  toString  and __str__ 
 def __str__(self): 
     return string  
 
equivalent to Java's toString  (converts object to "
"a string)  
invoked automatically when str or print  is called  
 
Exercise: Write a __str__  method for Point  objects that returns strings 
like  ""(3, -14)"" 
 
def __str__(self):

"Working with DataVariables
Variables are names that refer to a value stored in memory.
Rules
You cannot use one of the Python key words as a variable 
name
A variable name cannot contain spaces
First character must be a letter or an underscore
After the first character you may use letters, digits, or 
underscores
Uppercase and lowercase characters are distinct.
You many use up to 32 characters for a nameCreating Variables
Variables are used to store data. 
Create a variable by assigning data to it

"Python Variables 
Fall 2019 Variables 
●Variable - a name that represents a value stored in the computer’s memory 
●Assignment statement - used to assign a value to a variable (=) 
○variable = value 
●Variables can be reassigned -- they aren’t set in stone when assigned once 
2Variable Naming 
●Variables must have a name to be used 
●Your names must always start with a letter or underscore, but they can only 
contain these types characters 
○Letters (capital and lowercase) 
○Numbers 
○Underscores 
●Valid va"
"riable names: 
○firstName, LastName, first_name, last_name, name1, name2, _name1 
●Invalid variable names: 
○1name, 2name, first name, firstName! 
3Variable Naming 
●Python contains some reserved keywords valuable to the functionality of 
Python 
○Your variable name cannot be a Python keyword 
■It can contain a keyword (valid: className), but it cannot be solely 
the keyword (invalid: class) 
●Have descriptive variable names (give a hint what it will be used for) 
4
Data Types 
●Programming languages have d"
"ifferent types they can store data in 
●Some of the most basic types are: 
○Integers (int) 
■Whole numbers (1, 2, 3, 4… etc) 
○Floating point (float) 
■Decimals (1.0, 1.2, 1.5… etc) 
○Strings 
■Words, sentences, can contain numbers and special characters also 
○Booleans 
■True/False values 
5Declaring Variables 
●Python doesn’t have explicit data typing 
○You don’t have to tell Python what type you’re storing in the variable 
○It determines this based on how the data is entered into the variable 
●Python is"
" case sensitive 
○If you declare a variable “temp” then “Temp”, “tEmp”, etc. will not work 
●Examples: 
○temp = 1 (integer) 
○temp = 1.0 (floating point) 
○temp = “Hello World” (string) 
○temp = True (boolean) 
6
Declaring Variables: Notes 
●Integers 
○Declared as a number with no quotation marks and without  a decimal 
●Floating points 
○Declared as a number with no quotation marks and with a decimal 
●Strings 
○Declared as characters encompassed by quotation marks 
○Can be numbers, letters, or special sym"
"bols (“2” would be a string, not an 
integer) 
●Booleans 
○Declared as True or False outside of quotation marks (this is case 
sensitive  meaning true/false does not read as a boolean and will throw an 
error) 7Printing: Data Types 
●Different data types also introduces printing different data types 
○print(“Hello World”) will print a string 
■As stated previously, print(Hello World) would not work; this is 
because Hello World is a string and needs quotations to print 
○print(1) will print an integer 
■Thi"
"s does not need quotations to print as it reads the 1 as an integer 
○print(1.0) will print a floating point 
○print(True) will print a boolean 
8
Printing: Variables 
●You can print variables directly to your screen 
○To print a variable you have to assign a value to it 
■Ex. temp = 1 
○Then, you insert the name into a print statement 
■print(temp) 
○If you add quotations it will print what is in the quotations directly 
■print(“temp”) will print “temp”, not 1 
○If you don’t maintain the exact name (down t"
"o casing), it will throw an 
error 
■print(Temp) will cause your program to crash 
9Printing: Variables 
●Variables can be print in a compound statement 
○They can be print with more than one variable per print statement 
○They can also be print with an accompanying string (or two, three, etc.) 
●Example: 
○message = “Hello World” 
○print(“Message:”,  message) will print “Message: Hello World” 
●Example: 
○number = 1 
○print(“My number is:”, number) will print “My number is: 1” 
10
Printing: Notes 
●The oth"
"er way to print a compound statement “+” works only with string data 
types 
○Example 
■temp = “Kortni” 
■print(“Hello, my name is “ + temp) will work 
■print(“Hello, my name is “ + “Kortni”) will work 
○Example 
■temp = 1 
■print(“My number is “ + temp) will not work 
■print(“My number is “ + 1) will not work 
●This will become explained when arithmetic is introduced
