# Abbreviator.py
""" Inputs a string that encodes a name that is either one or
    two words and displays its abbreviation according to certain rules.

Rules:
    1. A two-word name begins with either 'NEW', 'WEST', 'NORTH', or 'SOUTH'.
    2. If the name is two words, then a single blank separates
    the words and the abbreviation consists of  the first
    letters of each, e.g., NEW JERSEY --> NJ
    3. If the name is one word, then its abbreviation is its
    first two letters, e.g., MASSACHUSETTS --> MA
